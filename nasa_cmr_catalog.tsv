DLR developed and delivered a Visual/Near-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer to Teledyne Brown Engineering, which was responsible for integrating the instrument. Teledyne Brown designed and constructed, integrated and tested the platform before delivered to NASA. Teledyne Brown collaborates with DLR in several areas, including basic and applied research for use of data. DESIS is operated in the wavelength range from visible through the near infrared and enables precise data acquisition from Earth's surface for applications including fire-detection, change detection, maritime domain awareness, and atmospheric research. Three product types can be ordered, which are Level 1B (systematic and radiometric corrected), Level 1C (geometrically corrected) and Level 2A (atmospherically corrected). The spatial resolution is about 30m on ground. DESIS is sensitive between 400nm and 1000nm with a spectral resolution of about 3.3nm. DESIS data are delivered in tiles of about 30x30km.

The goal of the product is to provide the user with actual Sea Surface Temperature (SST) maps in a defined format easy to access with the highest possible reliability on the thematic quality. After a phase of definition, the operational production chain was launched in March 1993 covering the entire Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Since then, daily, weekly, and monthly data sets have been available until September 13, 1994, when the AVHRR on board the NOAA-11 spacecraft failed. The production of daily, weekly and monthly SST maps was resumed in February, 1995, based on NOAA-14 AVHRR data. The NOAA-14 AVHRR sensor became some technical difficulties, so the generation was stopped on October 3, 2001. Since March 2002, NOAA-16 AVHRR SST maps are available again. With the beginning of January 2004, the data of AVHRR on board of NOAA-16 exhibited some anormal features showing strips in the scenes. Facing the “bar coded” images of NOAA16-AVHRR which occurred first in September 2003, continued in January 2004 for the second time and appeared in April 2004 again, DFD has decided to stop the reception of NOAA16 data on April 6th, 2004, and to start the reception of NOAA-17 data on this day. On April 7th, 2004, the production of all former NOAA16-AVHRR products as e.g. the SST composites was successully established. NOAA-17 is an AM sensor which passes central Europe about 2 hours earlier than NOAA-16 (about 10:00 UTC instead of 12:00 UTC for NOAA-16). In spring 2007, the communication system of NOAA-17 has degraded or is operating with limitations. Therefore, DFD has decided to shift the production of higher level products (NDVI, LST and SST) from NOAA-17 to NOAA-18 in April 2007. In order to test the performance of our processing chains, we processed simultaneously all NOAA-17 and NOAA-18 data from January 1st, 2007 till March 29th, 2007. All products are be available via EOWEB. Please remember that NOAA-18 is a PM sensor which passes central Europe about 1.5 hours later than NOAA-17 (about 11:30 UTC instead of 10:00 UTC for NOAA17). The SST product is intended for climate modelers, oceanographers, and all geo science-related disciplines dealing with ocean surface parameters. In addition, SST maps covering the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the Western Atlantic equivalent to the Mediterranean MCSST maps are available since August 1994. The most important aspects of the MCSST maps are a) correct image registration and b) reasonable cloud screening to ensure that only cloud free pixels are taken for the later processing and compositing c) for deriving MCSST, only channel 4 and 5 are used.. The SST product consists of one 8 bit channel. For additional information, please see: https://wdc.dlr.de/sensors/avhrr/	not-provided

The total size covering Europe is 4100 samples by 4300 lines. Within 24 hours of acquiring data from the satellite, day-time and night-time LSTs are calculated. In general, the products utilise data from all six of the passes that the satellite makes over Europe in each 24 hour period. For the daily day-time LST maps, the compositing criterion for the three day-time passes is maximum NDVI value and for daily night-time LST maps, the criterion is the maximum night-time LST value of the three night-time passes. Weekly and monthly day-time or night-time LST composite products are also produced by averaging daily day-time or daily night-time LST values, respectively. The range of LST values is scaled between –39.5°C and +87°C with a radiometric resolution of 0.5°C. A value of –40°C is used for water. Clouds are masked out as bad values.

In particular, crop type information is essential to understand the spatial distribution of water usage and anticipate the risk of water scarcity and the consequent danger of food insecurity. This applies to arid regions such as the Aral Sea Basin (ASB), Central Asia, where agriculture relies heavily on irrigation. Here, remote sensing is valuable to map crop types, but its quality depends on consistent ground-truth data. Yet, in the ASB, such data is missing. Addressing this issue, we collected thousands of polygons on crop types, 97.7% of which in Uzbekistan and the remaining in Tajikistan. We collected 8,196 samples between 2015 and 2018, 213 in 2011 and 26 in 2008. Our data compiles samples for 40 crop types and is dominated by “cotton” (40%) and “wheat”, (25%). These data were meticulously validated using expert knowledge and remote sensing data and relied on transferable, open-source workflows that will assure the consistency of future sampling campaigns.	not-provided

They modulate upwelling of carbon-rich deep water and, with sea ice, determine the ocean surface area available for air–sea gas exchange. Some models indicate that the current strengthening and poleward shift of these winds will weaken the carbon sink. If correct, centennial- to millennial-scale reconstructions of the SHW intensity should be linked with past changes in atmospheric CO2, temperature and sea ice. Here we present a 12,300-year reconstruction of wind strength based on three independent proxies that track inputs of sea-salt aerosols and minerogenic particles accumulating in lake sediments on sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. Between about 12.1 thousand years ago (ka) and 11.2 ka, and since about 7 ka, the wind intensities were above their long-term mean and corresponded with increasing atmospheric CO2. Conversely, from about 11.2 to 7.2 ka, the wind intensities were below their long-term mean and corresponded with decreasing atmospheric CO2. These observations are consistent with model inferences of enhanced SHW contributing to the long-term outgassing of CO2 from the Southern Ocean.	not-provided

Data collection for this product is complete.    ACCLIP is an international, multi-organizational suborbital campaign that aims to study aerosols and chemical transport that is associated with the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) in the Western Pacific region from 15 July 2022 to 31 August 2022. The ASM is the largest meteorological pattern in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the summer and is associated with persistent convection and large anticyclonic flow patterns in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). This leads to significant enhancements in the UTLS of trace species that originate from pollution or biomass burning. Convection connected to the ASM occurs over South, Southeast, and East Asia, a region with complex and rapidly changing emissions due to its high population density and economic growth. Pollution that reaches the UTLS from this region can have significant effects on the climate and chemistry of the atmosphere, making it important to have an accurate representation and understanding of ASM transport, chemical, and microphysical processes for chemistry-climate models to characterize these interactions and for predicting future impacts on climate. The ACCLIP campaign is conducted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) with the primary goal of investigating the impacts of Asian gas and aerosol emissions on global chemistry and climate. The NASA WB-57 and NCAR G-V aircraft are outfitted with state-of-the-art sensors to accomplish this. ACCLIP seeks to address four scientific objectives related to its main goal. The first is to investigate the transport pathways of ASM uplifted air from inside of the anticyclone to the global UTLS. Another objective is to sample the chemical content of air processed in the ASM in order to quantify the role of the ASM in transporting chemically active species and short-lived climate forcing agents to the UTLS to determine their impact on stratospheric ozone chemistry and global climate. Third, information is obtained on aerosol size, mass, and chemical composition that is necessary for determining the radiative effects of the ASM to constrain models of aerosol formation and for contrasting the organic-rich ASM UTLS aerosol population with that of the background aerosols. Last, ACCLIP seeks to measure the water vapor distribution associated with the monsoon dynamical structure to evaluate transport across the tropopause and determine the role of the ASM in water vapor transport in the stratosphere.	not-provided

In order to improve our understanding of the effect of aerosols on climate and air quality, measurements of aerosol chemical composition, size distribution, height profile, and optical properties are of crucial importance. In terms of remotely sensed instrumentation, the most extensive set of aerosol properties can be obtained by combining passive multi-angle, multi-spectral measurements of intensity and polarization with active measurements performed by a High Spectral Resolution Lidar. During Fall 2017, the Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar (ACEPOL) campaign, jointly sponsored by NASA and the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON), performed aerosol and cloud measurements over the United States from the NASA high altitude ER-2 aircraft. Six instruments were deployed on the aircraft. Four of these instruments were multi-angle polarimeters: the Airborne Hyper Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (AirHARP), the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI), the Airborne Spectrometer for Planetary Exploration (SPEX Airborne) and the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). The other two instruments were lidars: the High Spectral Resolution Lidar 2 (HSRL-2) and the Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL). The ACEPOL operation was based at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale California, which enabled observations of a wide variety of scene types, including urban, desert, forest, coastal ocean and agricultural areas, with clear, cloudy, polluted and pristine atmospheric conditions. The primary goal of ACEPOL was to assess the capabilities of the different polarimeters for retrieval of aerosol and cloud microphysical and optical parameters, as well as their capabilities to derive aerosol layer height (near-UV polarimetry, O2 A-band). ACEPOL also focused on the development and evaluation of aerosol retrieval algorithms that combine data from both active (lidar) and passive (polarimeter) instruments. ACEPOL data are appropriate for algorithm development and testing, instrument intercomparison, and investigations of active and passive instrument data fusion, which is a valuable resource for remote sensing communities as they prepare for the next generation of spaceborne MAP and lidar missions.	not-provided

After the OCO-2 launch,  ""ACOS"" data are still produced and improved, using approaches applied to the OCO-2 spectra.  The ""ACOS"" data set contains Carbon Dioxide (CO2) column averaged dry air mole fraction for all soundings for which retrieval was attempted. These are the highest-level products made available by the OCO Project, using TANSO-FTS spectral radiances, and algorithm build version 7.3.  The GOSAT team at JAXA produces GOSAT TANSO-FTS Level 1B (L1B) data products for internal use and for distribution to collaborative partners, such as ESA and NASA.

Thus produced Level 1B products (with calibrated radiances and geolocation) are the input to the ""ACOS"" Level 2 production process.  Even though the GES DISC is not publicly distributing Level 1B ACOS products, it should be known that changes in this version are affecting both Level 1B and Level 2 data. An important enhancement in Level1B will address the degradation in the number of quality-passed soundings.   Elimination of many systematic biases, and better agreement with TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network), is expected in Level 2 retrievals. The key changes to the L2 algorithm include scaling the O2-A band spectroscopy (reducing XCO2 bias by 4 or 5 ppm); using interpolation with the instrument lineshape [ ILS ] (reducing XCO2 bias by 1.5 ppm); and fitting a zero level offset to the A-band. Users have to also carefully familiarize themselves with the disclaimer in the new documentation.   An important element to note are the updates on data screening.

The ADAM climatologies that feed the ADAM calculation tools are:  For ocean:  monthly chlorophyll concentration derived from SeaWiFS-OrbView-2 (1999-2009); it is used to compute the water column reflectance (which shows large spectral variations in the visible, but is insignificant in the near and mid infrared). monthly wind speed derived from SeaWinds-QuikSCAT-(1999-2009); it is used to calculate the ocean glint reflectance. For land:  monthly normalized surface reflectances in the 7 MODIS narrow spectral bands derived from FondsdeSol processing chain of MOD09A1 products (derived from Aqua and Terra observations), on which relies the modelling of the hyperspectral/multidirectional surface (soil/vegetation/snow) reflectance. uncertainty variance-covariance matrix for the 7 spectral bands associated to the normalized surface reflectance. For sea-ice:  Sea ice pixels (masked in the original MOD09A1 products) have been accounted for by a gap-filling approach relying on the spatial-temporal distribution of sea ice coverage provided by the CryoClim climatology for year 2005.	not-provided

Data are       collected from  selected areas over the conterminous United States,       Alaska, and Hawaii by  NASA ER-2 and NASA C-130B aircraft, operating       from the NASA Ames Research  Center in Moffett Field, California, and by       NASA Learjet aircraft, operating  from Stennis Space Center in Bay St.       Louis, Mississippi.  Limited  international acquisitions also are       available.              In cooperation with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Daedalus        Enterprises,Inc., NASA developed several multispectral sensors.  The       data  acquired from these sensors supports NASA's Airborne Science and       Applications  Program and have been identified as precursors to the       instruments scheduled to  fly on Earth Observing System platforms.              THEMATIC MAPPER SIMULATOR              The Thematic Mapper Simulator (TMS) sensor is a line scanning device          designed for a variety of Earth science applications.  Flown aboard              NASA ER-2 aircraft, the TMS sensor has a nominal Instantaneous Field  of              View of 1.25 milliradians with a ground resolution of 81 feet (25  meters)              at 65,000 feet. The TMS sensor scans at a rate of 12.5 scans per  second              with 716 pixels per scan line.  Swath width is 8.3 nautical miles              (15.4 kilometers) at 65,000 feet while the scanner's Field of View  is              42.5 degrees.                NS-001 MULTISPECTRAL SCANNER               The NS-001multispectral scanner is a line scanning device designed  to              simulate Landsat thematic mapper (TM) sensor performance, including  a              near infrared/short-wave infrared band used in applications similar  to those         of the TM sensor (e.g., Earth resources mapping, vegetation/land  cover          mapping, geologic studies).  Flown aboard NASA C-130B aircraft, the  NS-001       sensor has a nominal Instantaneous Field of View of 2.5 milliradians     with a       ground resolution of 25 feet (7.6 meters) at 10,000 feet.  The sensor has a       variable scan rate (10 to 100 scans per second) with 699  pixels per scan line,       but the available motor drive supply restricts the  maximum stable scan speed       to approximately 85 revolutions per second. A scan rate  of 100 revolutions per       second is possible, but not probable, for short  scan lines; therefore, a       combination of factors, including aircraft  flight requirements and maximum       scan speed, prevent scanner operation below 1,500 feet.  Swath width is 3.9       nautical miles (7.26 kilometers) at 10,000 feet, and the total scan angle or       field of regard for the sensor is 100 degrees, plus or minus 15 degrees for       roll compensation.       THERMAL INFRARED MULTISPECTRAL SCANNER       The Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) sensor is a line  scanning         device originally designed for geologic applications.  Flown aboard NASA       C-130B, NASA ER-2, and NASA Learjet aircraft, the TIMS sensor  has a              nominal Instantaneous Field of View of 2.5 milliradians with a  ground              resolution of 25 feet (7.6 meters) at 10,000 feet.  The sensor has a              selectable scan rate (7.3, 8.7, 12, or 25 scans per second) with 698  pixels          per scan line.  Swath width is 2.6 nautical miles (4.8 kilometers)  at            10,000 feet while the scanner's Field of View is 76.56 degrees.	not-provided

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AMSU-A instrument is co-aligned with AIRS so that successive blocks of 3 x 3 AIRS footprints are contained within one AMSU-A footprint. AMSU-A is primarily a temperature sounder that provides atmospheric information in the presence of clouds, which can be used to correct the AIRS infrared measurements for the effects of clouds. This is possible because non-precipitating clouds are for the most part transparent to microwave radiation, in contrast to visible and infrared radiation which are strongly scattered and absorbed by clouds. AMSU-A1 has 13 channels from 50 - 90 GHz and AMSU-A2 has 2 channels from 23 - 32 GHz. The AIRABRAD_005 products are stored in files (often referred to as ""granules"") that contain 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints across track by 45 lines along track."	not-provided

AK_AVHRR	Alaska AVHRR Twice-Monthly Composites	USGS_LTA	1990-06-16		-179, 51, -116, 70	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1220565954-USGS_LTA.json	The goal of the Alaska Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer  (AVHRR) project is to compile a time series data set of calibrated,  georegistered  daily observations and twice-monthly maximum normalized difference  vegetation index (NDVI) composites for Alaska's annual growing  season (April-October). This data set has applications for environmental monitoring and for assessing impacts of global climate change.  An Alaska AVHRR data set is comprised of twice-monthly maximum NDVI composites of daily satellite observations.  The NDVI composites  contain 10 bands of information, including AVHRR channels 1-5, maximum NDVI, satellite zenith, solar zenith, and relative azimuth.  The daily   observations, bands 1-9, have been calibrated to reflectance, scaled  to   byte data, and geometrically registered to the Albers Equal-Area  Conic map projection. The 10th band is a pointer to identify the date and  scene ID of  the source daily observation (scene) for each pixel.  The compositing process required each daily overpass to be  registered to a common map projection to ensure that from day to day each 1-km pixel represented the exact same ground location.  The Albers Equal-Area Conic map projection provides for equal area representation, which enables  easy measurement of area throughout the data.  Each daily observation for  the growing season was registered to a base image using image-to-image correlation.  The NDVI data are calculated from the calibrated, geometrically  registered daily observations. The NDVI value is the difference between  near-infrared (AVHRR Channel 2) and visible (AVHRR Channel 1) reflectance values  divided by total measured reflectance.  A maximum NDVI compositing process  was used on the daily observations.  The NDVI is examined pixel by pixel for  each observation during the compositing period to determine and retain  the maximum value.  Often when displaying data covering large areas, such as AVHRR data,  it is beneficial to include an overlay of either familiar linework for  reflectance or polygon data sets to derive statistical summaries of regions.  All of the linework images represent lines in raster format as 1-km cells and  the strata are represented as polygons registered to the AVHRR data.  The  linework and polygon data sets include international boundaries, Alaskan roads  with the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, and a raster polygon mask of the State. 	not-provided

The maps report Sky brightness temperatures in Kelvin gridded on the Earth Centered Inertial (ECI) reference frame epoch J2000. They are sampled over 721 Declinations between -90 degrees and +90 degrees and 1441 Right Ascensions between 0 degrees and 360 degrees, all evenly spaced at 0.25 degrees intervals. The brightness temperatures are assumed temporally invariant and polarization has been neglected.  They include microwave continuum and atomic hydrogen line (HI) emissions. The maps differ only in how the strong radio source Cassiopeia A has been included into the whole sky background surveys: 1/ TB_no_Cas_A does not include Cassiopeia A and reports only the whole Sky surveys. 2/ TB_Cas_A_1cell spread Cas A total flux homogeneously over 1 map grid cell (i.e. 9.8572E-6 sr). 3/ TB_Cas_A_beam spreads Cas A over surrounding grid cells using a convolution by a Gaussian beam with HPBW of 35 arcmin (equivalent to the instrument used for the Sky surveys). Cassiopeia A  is a supernova remnant (SNR) in the constellation Cassiopeia and the brightest extra-solar radio source in the sky at frequencies above 1."	not-provided

CAP is a P.I. produced dataset developed and provided by JPL.  This Level 2 dataset contains sea surface salinity (SSS), wind speed and wind direction data derived from 3 different radiometers and the onboard scatterometer. The CAP algorithm simultaneously retrieves the salinity, wind speed and direction by minimizing the sum of squared differences between model and observations. The main improvements in CAP V5.0 relative to the previous version include: updates to the Geophysical Model Functions to 4th order harmonics with the inclusion of sea surface temperature (SST) and stability at air-sea interface effects; use of the Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC) SST product as the new source ancillary sea surface temperature data in place of NOAA OI SST. Each L2 data file covers one 98 minute orbit. The Aquarius instrument is onboard the AQUARIUS/SAC-D satellite, a collaborative effort between NASA and the Argentinian Space Agency Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE). The instrument consists of three radiometers in push broom alignment at incidence angles of 29, 38, and 46 degrees incidence angles relative to the shadow side of the orbit. Footprints for the beams are: 76 km (along-track) x 94 km (cross-track), 84 km x 120 km and 96km x 156 km, yielding a total cross-track swath of 370 km. The radiometers measure brightness temperature at 1.413 GHz in their respective horizontal and vertical polarizations (TH and TV). A scatterometer operating at 1.26 GHz measures ocean backscatter in each footprint that is used for surface roughness corrections in the estimation of salinity. The scatterometer has an approximate 390km swath.	not-provided

See also the metadata records for the 4 hour extraction of HCl, and the time trial data for 1 M HCl extractions.  A regional survey of potential contaminants in marine or estuarine sediments is often one of the first steps in a post-disturbance environmental impact assessment. Of the many different chemical extraction or digestion procedures that have been proposed to quantify metal contamination, partial acid extractions are probably the best overall compromise between selectivity, sensitivity, precision, cost and expediency.  The extent to which measured metal concentrations relate to the anthropogenic fraction that is bioavailable is contentious, but is one of the desired outcomes of an assessment or prediction of biological impact.  As part of a regional survey of metal contamination associated with Australia's past waste management activities in Antarctica, we wanted to identify an acid type and extraction protocol that would allow a reasonable definition of the anthropogenic bioavailable fraction for a large number of samples.  From a kinetic study of the 1 M HCl extraction of two certified Certified Reference Materials (MESS-2 and PACS-2) and two Antarctic marine sediments, we concluded that a 4 hour extraction time allows the equilibrium dissolution of relatively labile metal contaminants, but does not favour the extraction of natural geogenic metals.  In a regional survey of 88 marine samples from the Casey Station area of East Antarctica, the 4 h extraction procedure correlated best with biological data, and most clearly identified those sediments thought to be contaminated by runoff from abandoned waste disposal sites.  Most importantly the 4 hour extraction provided better definition of the low to moderately contaminated locations by picking up small differences in anthropogenic metal concentrations.  For the purposes of inter-regional comparison, we recommend a 4 hour 1 M HCl acid extraction as a standard method for assessing metal contamination in Antarctica.

Hence, this is an excellent place to monitor global background levels of these organochlorines. In this project concentrations in penguins and petrels will be compared to 10 years ago, which will show time trends of global background contamination levels.  Data set description From several birds from Hop Island, Rauer Islands near Davis, samples were  collected from preenoil (oil that birds excrete to preen their feathers. This preenoil was then analysed for organochlorine pollutants like polychlorinated  biphenyls, (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), DDE and dieldrin. The species  under investigation were the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) and the  Southern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides). The samples were collected from adult  breeding birds, and stored in -20 degrees C as soon as possible. The analysis  was done with relatively standard but very optimised methods, using a  gas-chromatograph and mass-selective detection.    Data sheets: The data are available in excel-sheets, located at Alterra, The Netherlands (the affiliation of the PI Nico van den Brink.). Data are available on PCB153 (polychlorinated biphenyl congener numbered 153), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), DDE (a metabolite of the pesticide DDT), and dieldrin (an insecticide).  The metadata are in 4 sheets (in meta data 2357.xls): 1. 'Concentrations fulmars' 2. 'Morphometric data fulmars' 3. 'Concentrations Adelies' 4. 'Morphometric data Adelies'  The column headings are:   1.

The VNIR subsystem includes two independent telescope assemblies that facilitate the generation of stereoscopic data. The band 3 stereo pair is acquired in the spectral range of 0.78 and 0.86 microns with a base-to-height ratio of 0.6 and an intersection angle of 27.7 degrees. There is a time lag of approximately one minute between the acquisition of the nadir and backward images. For a better understanding, refer to this (diagram) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/301/ASTER_Along_Track_Imaging_Geometry.png) depicting the along-track imaging geometry of the ASTER VNIR nadir and backward-viewing sensors.    The accuracy of the new LP DAAC produced DEMs will meet or exceed accuracy specifications set for the ASTER relative DEMs by the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/81/AST14_ATBD.pdf). Users likely will find that the DEMs produced by the new LP DAAC system have accuracies approaching those specified in the ATBD for absolute DEMs. Validation testing has shown that DEMs produced by the new system frequently are more accurate than 25 meters root mean square error (RMSE) in xyz dimensions.    Improvements/Changes from Previous Versions    As of January 2021, the LP DAAC has implemented version 3.0 of the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation ASTER DEM/Ortho (SILCAST) software, which is used to generate the Level 2 on-demand ASTER Orthorectified and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) products (AST14). The updated software provides digital elevation extraction and orthorectification from ASTER L1B input data without needing to enter ground control points or depending on external global DEMs at 30-arc-second resolution (GTOPO30). It utilizes the ephemeris and attitude data derived from both the ASTER instrument and the Terra spacecraft platform. The outputs are geoid height-corrected and waterbodies are automatically detected in this version. Users will notice differences between AST14DEM, AST14DMO, and AST14OTH products ordered before January 2021 (generated with SILCAST V1) and those generated with the updated version of the production software (version 3.0). Differences may include slight elevation changes over different surface types, including waterbodies. Differences have also been observed over cloudy portions of ASTER scenes. Additional information on SILCAST version 3.0 can be found on the  SILCAST website (http://www.silc.co.jp/en/products.html).    Starting June 23, 2021, radiometric calibration coefficient Version 5 (RCC V5) will be applied to newly observed ASTER data and archived ASTER data products. Details regarding RCC V5 are described in the following journal article.

The development of the ASTER GDEM data products is a collaborative effort between National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). The ASTER GDEM data products are created by the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) in Tokyo.     The ASTER GDEM Version 3 data product was created from the automated processing of the entire ASTER Level 1A (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) archive of scenes acquired between March 1, 2000, and November 30, 2013. Stereo correlation was used to produce over one million individual scene based ASTER DEMs, to which cloud masking was applied. All cloud screened DEMs and non-cloud screened DEMs were stacked. Residual bad values and outliers were removed. In areas with limited data stacking, several existing reference DEMs were used to supplement ASTER data to correct for residual anomalies. Selected data were averaged to create final pixel values before partitioning the data into 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude tiles with a one pixel overlap. To correct elevation values of water body surfaces, the ASTER Global Water Bodies Database (ASTWBD) (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/ASTWBD.001) Version 1 data product was also generated.     The geographic coverage of the ASTER GDEM extends from 83° North to 83° South. Each tile is distributed in GeoTIFF format and projected on the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84)/1996 Earth Gravitational Model (EGM96) geoid.

The development of the ASTER GDEM data products is a collaborative effort between National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). The ASTER GDEM data products are created by the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) in Tokyo.   The ASTER GDEM Version 3 data product was created from the automated processing of the entire ASTER Level 1A (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) archive of scenes acquired between March 1, 2000, and November 30, 2013. Stereo correlation was used to produce over one million individual scene based ASTER DEMs, to which cloud masking was applied. All cloud screened DEMs and non-cloud screened DEMs were stacked. Residual bad values and outliers were removed. In areas with limited data stacking, several existing reference DEMs were used to supplement ASTER data to correct for residual anomalies. Selected data were averaged to create final pixel values before partitioning the data into 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude tiles with a one pixel overlap. To correct elevation values of water body surfaces, the ASTER Global Water Bodies Database (ASTWBD) (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/ASTWBD.001) Version 1 data product was also generated.   The geographic coverage of the ASTER GDEM extends from 83° North to 83° South.

This is so we can analyse benthic data in relation to habitat, ie. did we trawl over a slope or was the sea floor relatively flat.  Note that the depth range in the plots is autoscaled to the data, so a small range in depths appears as a scatetring of points.  As long as you look at the depth scale though interpretation will be ok.  The R files need a file of bathymetry data in '200708V3_one_minute.csv' which is a file containing a data export from the underway PostgreSQL ship database and 'events.csv' which is a stripped down version of the events export from the ship board events database export.  If you wish to run the code again you may need to change the pathnames in the R script to relevant locations.  If you have opened the csv files in excel at any stage and the R script gets an error you may need to format the date/time columns as yyyy-mm-dd hh;mm:ss, save and close the file as csv without opening it again and then run the R script.  However, all output files are here for every CEAMARC event.  Filenames contain a reference to CEAMARC event id.  Files are in eps format and can be viewed using Ghostview which is available as a free download on the internet.	not-provided

The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities. Requirement:  Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years. The CEOS should encourage a member agency to accept the lead role in supporting this activity. CEOS should request all member agencies to support this activity by providing appropriate information and data in a timely manner.  Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS): Algeria 3 is one of six CEOS reference Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) that are CEOS Reference Test Sites. Besides the nominally good site characteristics (temporal stability, uniformity, homogeneity, etc.), these six PICS were selected by also taking into account their heritage and the large number of datasets from multiple instruments that already existed in the EO archives and the long history of characterization performed over these sites. The PICS have high reflectance and are usually made up of sand dunes with climatologically low aerosol loading and practically no vegetation. Consequently, these PICS can be used to evaluate the long-term stability of instrument and facilitate inter-comparison of multiple instruments.	not-provided

Derived from a careful review of the environmental literature, these twin goals mirror the priorities expressed by policymakers. Environmental health and ecosystem vitality are gauged using 25 indicators tracked in six well-established policy categories: Environmental Health (Environmental Burden of Disease, Water, and Air Pollution), Air Pollution (effects on ecosystems), Water (effects on ecosystems), Biodiversity and Habitat, Productive Natural Resources (Forestry, Fisheries, and Agriculture), and Climate Change. The 2008 EPI utilizes a proximity-to-target methodology in which performance on each indicator is rated on a 0 to 100 scale (100 represents ï¿½at targetï¿½). By identifying specific targets and measuring how close each country comes to them, the EPI provides a foundation for policy analysis and a context for evaluating performance. Issue-by-issue and aggregate rankings facilitate cross-country comparisons both globally and within relevant peer groups. The 2008 EPI is the result of collaboration among the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), World Economic Forum (WEF), and the Joint Research Centre (JRC), European Commission.	not-provided

When applied to the combination of daytime spectral and nighttime lights satellite data, the machine learning methods achieved high accuracy at an intermediate-resolution of 500 meters at large spatial scales. The input data for these models were two types of satellite imagery: Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nighttime Light (NTL) data from the Day/Night Band (DNB), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) corrected daytime Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Although several machine learning methods were evaluated, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Neural Network (NN), and the Ensemble of RF, GBM, and NN (ESB), the highest accuracy results were achieved with NN, and those results were used to delineate the urban extents in this data set.	not-provided

The dataset is specifically inspired from a climate forecasting setting (seasonal timescales) where the task is to predict regional climate variability given global climate information lagged in time. The dataset consists of a synthetic input X (series of 2D arrays of random fields drawn from a multivariate normal distribution) and a synthetic output Y (scalar series) generated by using a nonlinear function F: R^d -> R.<br><br>The synthetic input aims to represent temporally independent realizations of anomalous global fields of sea surface temperature, the synthetic output series represents some type of regional climate variability that is of interest (temperature, precipitation totals, etc.) and the function F is a simplification of the climate system.<br><br>Since the nonlinear function F that is used to generate the output given the input is known, we also derive and provide the attribution of each output value to the corresponding input features. Using this synthetic dataset users can train any AI model to predict Y given X and then implement XAI methods to interpret it. Based on the “ground truth” of attribution of F the user can assess the faithfulness of any XAI method.<br><br>NOTE: the spatial configuration of the observations in the NetCDF database file conform to the planetocentric coordinate system (89.5N - 89.5S, 0.5E - 359.5E), where longitude is measured in the positive heading east from the prime meridian.	not-provided

Known Issues: *Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.  *Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.  *Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.  	not-provided

The MERIS instrument is a moderate-resolution wide field-of-view push-broom imaging spectroradiometer capable of sensing in the 390 nm to 1040 nm spectral range. Being a programmable instrument, it had the unique capability of selectively adjusting the width and location of its 15 bands through ground command. The instrument has a 68.5-degree field of view and a swath width of 1150 meters, providing a global coverage every 3 days at 300 m resolution.  Communication with the Envisat-1 satellite was lost suddenly on the 8th of April, 2012, just weeks after celebrating its 10th year in orbit. All attempts to re-establish contact were unsuccessful, and the end of the mission was declared on May 9th, 2012.    The 4th reprocessing cycle, in 2020, has produced both the full-resolution and reduced-resolution L1 and L2 MERIS products. EN1_MDSI_MER_FRS_1P is the short-name for the MERIS Level-1 full resolution, full swath, geolocated and calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance product. This product contains the TOA upwelling spectral radiance measurements. The in-band reference irradiances for the 15 MERIS bands are computed by averaging the in-band solar irradiance for each pixel. Each pixel’s in-band solar irradiance is computed by integrating the reference solar spectrum with the band-pass of each pixel. The Level-1 product contains 22 data files: 15 files contain radiances for each band (one band per file) along with associated error estimates, and 7 annotation data files. It also includes a Manifest file that provides metadata information describing the product.	not-provided

The data were obtained by the USS Gurnard (SSN-662), a U.S. Navy submarine, on a traverse of the AIDJEX Main Experiment area in the Beaufort Sea from 07 April 1976 to 10 April 1976. The sea ice thickness derived from the ULS is given in feet.  The data are in a single ASCII text file: Aidjex_04_1976_uls.txt. The data in this text file are not formatted into columns; all data are presented in one long row separated by spaces. Little is known about the format of the file, so caution should be used when working with the data. NSIDC is providing this data as part of our effort to preserve historical data.  The data file begins with nine values that appear to be header information. These nine values include latitude and longitude values along with other unknown values. After the header, there are approximately 2100 measurements of what NSIDC believes is sea ice thickness in feet, however it is unclear how often these measurements were taken. After these 2100 values, another header of nine values occurs followed again by 2100 measurements. The file continues in this pattern through the remainder of the file. Users with information about the contents of the file are encouraged to contact <a href=""mailto:nsidc.org"">NSIDC User Services</a>.

G5NR.v1	GEOS-5 Nature Run data	NCCS	2005-05-15	2007-06-16	-180, 90, 179.9375, 90	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1634215803-NCCS.json	This specific GEOS-5 model configuration used to perform a two-year global,  non-hydrostatic mesoscale simulation for the period 2005-2007 at 7-km (3.5-km in the future) horizontal resolution.  Because this simulation is intended to serve as a reference Nature Run for Observing System  Simulation Experiments (OSSEs, e.g., Errico et al., 2012) it will be referred to as the 7-km GEOS-5  Nature Run or 7-km G5NR. This simulation has been performed with the Ganymed version of GEOS-  5, more specifically with CVS Tag wmp-Ganymed-4_0_BETA8.  In addition to standard meteorological parameters (wind, temperature, moisture, surface pressure),  this simulation includes 15 aerosol tracers (dust, sea-salt, sulfate, black and organic carbon), O3, CO  and CO2. This model simulation is driven by prescribed sea-surface temperature and sea-ice, as well  as surface emissions and uptake of aerosols and trace gases, including daily volcanic and biomass  burning emissions, biogenic sources and sinks of CO2, and high-resolution inventories of  anthropogenic sources.The simulation is performed at a horizontal resolution of 7 km using a cubed-sphere horizontal  grid with 72 vertical levels, extending up to to 0.01 hPa (~ 80 km). For user convenience, all data  products are generated on two logically rectangular longitude-latitude grids: a full-resolution  0.0625o grid that approximately matches the native cubed-sphere resolution, and another 0.5o  reduced-resolution grid. The majority of the full-resolution data products are instantaneous with  some fields being time-averaged. The reduced-resolution datasets are mostly time-averaged, with  some fields being instantaneous. Hourly data intervals are used for the reduced-resolution datasets,  while 30-minute intervals are used for the full-resolution products. All full-resolution output is on  the model’s native 72-layer hybrid sigma-pressure vertical grid, while the reduced-resolution  output is given on native vertical levels and on 48 pressure surfaces extending up to 0.02 hPa.  Section 4 presents additional details on horizontal and vertical grids. 	not-provided

GEOS FP.v1	GEOS Forward Processing	NCCS	2014-02-20		-180, 90, 179.6875, 90	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1634094157-NCCS.json	The GEOS FP Atmospheric Data Assimilation System (GEOS ADAS) uses an analysis  developed jointly with NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), which  allows the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) to take advantage of the  developments at NCEP and the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA). The  GEOS AGCM uses the finite-volume dynamics (Lin, 2004) integrated with various physics  packages (e.g, Bacmeister et al., 2006), under the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)  including the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) (e.g., Koster et al., 2000). The GSI  analysis is a three-dimensional variational (3DVar) analysis applied in grid-point space to  facilitate the implementation of anisotropic, inhomogeneous covariances (e.g., Wu et al., 2002;  Derber et al., 2003). The GSI implementation for GEOS FP incorporates a set of recursive filters  that produce approximately Gaussian smoothing kernels and isotropic correlation functions.  The GEOS ADAS is documented in Rienecker et al. (2008). More recent updates to the model  are presented in Molod et al. (2011). The GEOS system actively assimilates roughly 2 ´ 106  observations for each analysis, including about 7.5 ´ 105 AIRS radiance data. The input stream  is roughly twice this volume, but because of the large volume, the data are thinned  commensurate with the analysis grid to reduce the computational burden. Data are also rejected  from the analysis through quality control procedures designed to detect, for example, the  presence of cloud.  To minimize the spurious periodic perturbations of the analysis, GEOS FP uses the Incremental  Analysis Update (IAU) technique developed by Bloom et al. (1996).	not-provided

This is a low relief tip of a bedrock  peninsula covered with several meters of glacial drift and reworked raised beach ridges. The measurements are obtained in the site of well developed patterned ground, sorted polygons, where the influence of plants, including thermal insulation and transpiration, is negligible. The 1985-1986 period was average. Mean annual air temperature was -6.6 C, 0.4 C colder than the long-term (1975-1990) mean, but well within the mean variability. Mean winter air temperature is relatively warm (mean of coldest month, February, is -14.6 C). Annual precipitation was 17 % greater than the ong-term mean (372 mm); however, the number of rain-on-snow events was less (3) than average (5.5). Overall, the reference period is close to long-term averages.     A program of automated soil temperature recordings was initiated in the summer of 1984, at a patterned ground field site Thermistors were placed approximately 0.1 m apart in an epoxy-filled PVC rod (18 mm outside diameter), buried in the center of a fine-grained domain of a sorted circle, down to 1.14 m below the ground surface. The data presented here covers 7/1/85-7/1/86, once a day (6 am), at two levels (0.0 m, 1.145 m below surface). The resolution of the thermistors is 0.004 C, and the accuracy is estimated to be 0.02 C near 0 C. Missing data accounts for less than 7 %. The gaps are filled with simple average of the beginning and end of the gap values. For a detailed description of the field site and data analysis see Putkonen (1997) and Hallet and Prestrud (1986).

We use six variations related to the treatment of the atmospheric composition, the calculation of aerosol indirect effects, and ocean model component. Specifically, we test the difference between atmospheric models that have noninteractive composition, where radiatively important aerosols and ozone are prescribed from precomputed decadal averages, and interactive versions where atmospheric chemistry and aerosols are calculated given decadally varying emissions. The impact of the first aerosol indirect effect on clouds is either specified using a simple tuning, or parameterized using a cloud microphysics scheme. We also use two dynamic ocean components: the Russell and HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) which differ significantly in their basic formulations and grid. Results are presented for the climatological means over the satellite era (1980-2004) taken from transient simulations starting from the preindustrial (1850) driven by estimates of appropriate forcings over the 20th Century. Differences in base climate and variability related to the choice of ocean model are large, indicating an important structural uncertainty. The impact of interactive atmospheric composition on the climatology is relatively small except in regions such as the lower stratosphere, where ozone plays an important role, and the tropics, where aerosol changes affect the hydrological cycle and cloud cover. While key improvements over previous versions of the model are evident, these are not uniform across all metrics.	not-provided

The data were compiled from a comprehensive survey of publications from the late 1970s to 2012 and include 3,422 data points from 315 papers. These data are from soil samples collected primarily at 0-15 cm depth with some from 0-30 cm. In addition, data were compiled for soil microbial biomass concentrations from soil profile samples to depths of 100 cm. Sampling site latitude and longitude were available for the majority of the samples that enabled assembling additional soil properties, site characteristics, vegetation distributions, biomes, and long-term climate data from several global sources of soil, land-cover, and climate data. These site attributes are included with the microbial biomass data. This data set contains two *.csv files of the soil microbial biomass C, N, P data. The first provides all compiled results emphasizing the full spatial extent of the data, while the second is a subset that provides only data from a series of profile samples emphasizing the vertical distribution of microbial biomass concentrations.There is a companion file, also in .csv format, of the references for the surveyed publications. A reference_number relates the data to the respective publication.The concentrations of soil microbial biomass, in combination with other soil databases, were used to estimate the global storage of soil microbial biomass C and N in 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm soil profiles. These storage estimates were combined with a spatial map of 12 major biomes (boreal forest, temperate coniferous forest, temperate broadleaf forest, tropical and subtropical forests, mixed forest, grassland, shrub, tundra, desert, natural wetland, cropland, and pasture) at 0.05-degree by 0.5-degree spatial resolution.

The resulting database includes 222 field and laboratory observations focused on rewetting of dry soils, and 116 field laboratory observations focused on thawing of frozen soils studies conducted from 1956 to 2010. Fluxes of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxide, and ammonia (CO2, CH4, N2O, NO and NH3) were compiled from the literature and the flux rates were normalized for ease of comparison. Field observations of gas flux following rewetting of dry soils include events caused by natural rainfall, simulated rainfall in natural ecosystems, and irrigation in agricultural lands. Similarly, thawing of frozen soils include field observations of natural thawing, simulated freezing-thawing events (i.e., thawing of simulated frozen soil by snow removal), and thawing of seasonal ice in temperate and high latitude regions (Kim et al., 2012). Reported parameters include experiment type, location, site type, vegetation, climate, soil properties, rainfall, soil moisture, soil gas flux after wetting and thawing, peak soil gas flux properties, and the corresponding study references. There is one comma-delimited data file. 	not-provided

It includes estimates of Vcmax (maximum rate of carboxylation), Jmax (maximum rate of electron transport), leaf nitrogen content (N), leaf phosphorus content (P), and specific leaf area (SLA) data from both experimental and ambient field conditions, for a total of 325 species and treatment combinations. Both the original published Vcmax and Jmax values as well as estimates at standard temperature are reported. The maximum rate of carboxylation (Vcmax) and the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax) are primary determinants of photosynthetic rates in plants, and modeled carbon fluxes are highly sensitive to these parameters. Previous studies have shown that Vcmax and Jmax correlate with leaf nitrogen across species and regions, and locally across species with leaf phosphorus and specific leaf area, yet no universal relationship suitable for global-scale models is currently available. These data are suitable for exploring the general relationships of Vcmax and Jmax with each other and with leaf N, P and SLA. This data set contains one *.csv file.	not-provided

MASL1B.v1	MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) Calibrated, Geolocated Radiances L1B 50m Data	LAADS	1993-01-11	2007-08-10	-180, -35, 180, 80	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C2799350215-LAADS.json	The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Airborne Simulator (MAS) sensor was developed for NASA's high-altitude ER-2 research aircraft by Daedalus Enterprises, Inc., in support of the MODIS remote sensing algorithm development. The overall goal was to modify the spectral coverage and gains of the MAS to emulate as many of the MODIS spectral channels as possible. With its much higher spatial resolution (50 m vs. 250-1000 m for MODIS), MAS is able to provide unique information on the small-scale distribution of various geophysical parameters. The MAS instrument has been deployed on multiple platforms for many field campaigns since its first mission in 1991, as the prototype Wildfire Spectrometer.

It is 1) the microphysical and scattering characteristics of pure aerosol upon which routine retrievals are based; 2) mixtures of pure aerosol to be compared with MISR observations; and 3) likelihood value assigned to each mode geographically. The ACP describes mixtures of up to three component aerosol types from a list of eight components, in varying proportions. ACP component aerosol particle data quality depends on the ACP input data, which are based on aerosol particles described in the literature, and consider MISR-specific sensitivity to particle size, single-scattering albedo, and shape, and shape - roughly: small, medium and large; dirty and clean; spherical and nonspherical [Kahn et al. , 1998; 2001]. Also reported in the ACP are the mixtures of these components used by the retrieval algorithm. The MISR instrument consists of nine pushbroom cameras which measure radiance in four spectral bands. Global coverage is achieved in nine days. The cameras are arranged with one camera pointing toward the nadir, four cameras pointing forward, and four cameras pointing aftward. It takes seven minutes for all nine cameras to view the same surface location. The view angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid, are 0, 26.1, 45.6, 60.0, and 70.5 degrees.

These data are generated from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance and in the process converted to geophysical units of W/(m^2 um sr). In addition, the Earth Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) may be determined for the solar reflective bands (1-19, 26) through knowledge of the solar irradiance (e.g., determined from MODIS solar diffuser data, and from the target illumination geometry).  Additional data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data.               Visible, shortwave infrared, and near infrared measurements are only made during the daytime, while radiances for the thermal infrared region (bands 20-25, 27-36) are measured continuously.

However, for the MODIS L1B 1 km product, the 250 m and 500 m band radiance data and their associated uncertainties have been aggregated to 1km resolution. Thus the entire channel data set is referenced to the same spatial and geolocation scales. Separate L1B products are available for the 250 m channels (MYD02QKM) and 500 m channels (MYD02HKM) that preserve the original resolution of the data.         Spatial resolution for pixels at nadir is 1 km, degrading to 4.8 km in the along-scan direction at the scan extremes. However, thanks to the overlapping of consecutive swaths and respectively pixels there, the resulting resolution at the scan extremes is about 2km.  A 55 degree scanning pattern at the EOS orbit of 705 km results in a 2330km orbital swath width and provides global coverage every one to two days. A single MODIS Level 1B granule will nominally contain a scene built from 203 scans (or swaths) sampled 1354 times in the cross-track direction, corresponding to approximately 5 minutes worth of data. Since an individual MODIS scan (or swath) will contain 10 along-track spatial elements, the scene will be composed of (1354 x 2030) pixels, resulting in a spatial coverage of (2330 km x 2030 km). Due to the  MODIS scan geometry, there will be increasing overlap occurring beyond about 25 degrees scan angle.         To summarize, the MODIS L1B 1 km data product consists of:          1. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (2) 250 m reflected solar bands aggregated to 1km resolution          2. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (5) 500 m reflected solar bands aggregated to 1 km resolution          3. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (13) 1 km reflected solar bands and (16) infrared emissive bands          4. Geolocation subsampled at every 5th pixel across and along track          5. Satellite and solar angles subsampled at the above frequency          6. Comprehensive set of file-level metadata summarizing the spatial, temporal and parameter attributes of the data, as well as auxiliary information pertaining to instrument status and data quality characterization.         The MODIS L1B data are stored in the Earth Observing System Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS) which is an extension of HDF as developed by the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. A typical file size will be approximately 260 MB.

MYD04_3K.v6.1NRT	MODIS/Aqua Aerosol 5-Min L2 Swath 3km - NRT	LANCEMODIS	2017-10-20		-180, -90, 180, 90	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1426717545-LANCEMODIS.json	The new Collection 6.1 (C61) MYD04_3K product is an improved version based on algorithm changes in Dark Target (DT) Aerosol retrieval over urban areas and uncertainty estimates for Deep Blue (DB) Aerosol retrievals.  The MODIS level-2 atmospheric aerosol product provides retrieved ambient aerosol optical properties, quality assurance, and other parameters, globally over ocean and land. In Collection 5, and earlier collections, there was only one aerosol product (MOD04_L2) at 10km (at nadir) spatial resolution. Starting from C6, the Dark Target (DT) Aerosol algorithm team provided a new 3 km spatial resolution product (MOD04_3k) intended for the air quality community.  The MOD04_3K product is based on the same algorithm and Look up Tables as the standard Dark Target aerosol product. Because of finer resolution, subtle differences are made in selecting pixels for retrieval and in determining QA. The only differences between the existing 10km algorithm and the 3km algorithm are: 1) the size of the pixel-arrays defining each retrieval box (6x6 retrieval boxes of 36 pixels at 0.5km resolution for 3km algorithm as oppose to 20x20 retrieval boxes of 400 pixels at 0.5km resolution for 10km product); 2) the minimum percentage of good pixels required for a retrieval (a minimum of 5 pixels over ocean and 6 pixels over land instead of a minimum of 10 pixels over ocean or 12 pixels over land for 10km product retrieval); 3) the 10km algorithm attempts a poor quality retrieval while 3km algorithm does not. Everything else is same in two products.

The project will perform a passive seismic experiment deploying twenty-three seismic stations over the GSM to characterize the structure of the crust and upper mantle, and determine the processes driving uplift. The outcomes will also offer constraints on the terrestrial heat flux, a key variable in modeling ice sheet formation and behavior. Virtually unexplored, the GSM represents the largest unstudied area of crustal uplift on earth. As well, the region is the starting point for growth of the Antarctic ice sheets.  Because of these outstanding questions, the GSM has been identified by the international Antarctic science community as a research focus for the International Polar Year (2007-2009). In addition to this seismic experiment, NSF is also supporting an aerogeophysical survey of the GSM under award number 0632292. Major international partners in the project include Germany, China, Australia, and the United Kingdom. For more information see IPY Project #67 at IPY.org. In terms of broader impacts, this project also supports postdoctoral and graduate student research, and various forms of outreach.	not-provided

The timing of the last deglaciation of the western Ross Sea will be improved using in situ terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (3He, 10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl) to date glacial erratics at key areas and elevations along the western Ross Sea coast. A state-of-the art ice sheet-shelf model will be used to identify mechanisms of deglaciation of the Ross Sea sector of WAIS. The model results and forcing will be compared with observations including the new cosmogenic data proposed here, with the aim of better determining and understanding the history and causes of WAIS deglaciation in the Ross Sea. There is considerable uncertainty, however, in the history of grounding line retreat from its last glacial maximum position, and virtually nothing is known about the timing of ice- surface lowering prior to ~10,000 years ago. Given these uncertainties, we are currently unable to assess one of the most important questions regarding the last deglaciation of the global ice sheets, namely as to whether the Ross Sea sector of WAIS contributed significantly to meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A), an extraordinarily rapid (~500-year duration) episode of ~20 m sea-level rise that occurred ~14,500 years ago. The intellectual merit of this project is that recent observations of startling changes at the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets indicate that dynamic responses to warming may play a much greater role in the future mass balance of ice sheets than considered in current numerical projections of sea level rise. The broader impacts of this work are that it has direct societal relevance to developing an improved understanding of the response of the West Antarctic ice sheet to current and possible future environmental changes including the sea-level response to glacier and ice sheet melting due to global warming. The PI will communicate results from this project to a variety of audiences through the publication of peer-reviewed papers and by giving talks to public audiences.

NSF-ANT10-43621	A Comparison of Conjugate Auroral Electojet Indices	AMD_USAPDC	2011-06-01	2013-05-31	-180, -79.5, 180, -54.5	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C2532069751-AMD_USAPDC.json	The auroral electrojet index (AE) is used as an indicator of geomagnetic activity at high latitudes representing the strength of auroral electrojet currents in the Northern polar ionosphere. A similar AE index for the Southern hemisphere is not available due to lack of complete coverage the Southern auroral zone (half of which extends over the ocean) with continuous magnetometer observations. While in general global auroral phenomena are expected to be conjugate, differences have been observed in the conjugate observations from the ground and from the Earth's satellites. These differences indicate a need for an equivalent Southern auroral geomagnetic activity index. The goal of this award is to create the Southern AE (SAE) index that would accurately reflect auroral activity in that hemisphere. With this index, it would be possible to investigate the similarities and the cause of differences between the SAE and 'standard' AE index from the Northern hemisphere. It would also make it possible to identify when the SAE does not provide a reliable calculation of the Southern hemisphere activity, and to determine when it is statistically beneficial to consider the SAE index in addition to the standard AE while analyzing geospace data from the Northern and Southern polar regions. The study will address these questions by creating the SAE index and its 'near-conjugate' NAE index from collected Antarctic magnetometer data, and will analyze variations in the cross-correlation of these indices and their differences as a function of geomagnetic activity, season, Universal Time, Magnetic Local Time, and interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind plasma parameters. The broader impact resulting from the proposed effort is in its importance to the worldwide geospace scientific community that currently uses only the standard AE index in a variety of geospace models as necessary input. 	not-provided
NSF-ANT13-55533.v1	A Multi-decadal Record of Antarctic Benthos: Image Analysis to Maximize Data Utilization	AMD_USAPDC	2013-10-01	2015-09-30	163, -78.5, 167, -78	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C2532070231-AMD_USAPDC.json	Antarctic benthic communities are characterized by many species of sponges (Phylum Porifera), long thought to exhibit extremely slow demographic patterns of settlement, growth and reproduction. This project will analyze many hundreds of diver and remotely operated underwater vehicle photographs documenting a unique, episodic settlement event that occurred between 2000 and 2010 in McMurdo Sound that challenges this paradigm of slow growth. Artificial structures were placed on the seafloor between 1967 and 1974 at several sites, but no sponges were observed to settle on these structures until 2004. By 2010 some 40 species of sponges had settled and grown to be surprisingly large. Given the paradigm of slow settlement and growth supported by the long observation period (37 years, 1967-2004), this extraordinary large-scale settlement and rapid growth over just a 6-year time span is astonishing. This project utilizes image processing software (ImageJ) to obtain metrics (linear dimensions to estimate size, frequency, percent cover) for sponges and other fauna visible in the photographs. It uses R to conduct multidimensional scaling to ordinate community data and ANOSIM to test for differences of community data among sites and times and structures. It will also use SIMPER and ranked species abundances to discriminate species responsible for any differences. This work focuses on Antarctic sponges, but the observations of massive episodic recruitment and growth are important to understanding seafloor communities worldwide. Ecosystems are composed of populations, and populations are ecologically described by their distribution and abundance. A little appreciated fact is that sponges often dominate marine communities, but because sponges are so hard to study, most workers focus on other groups such as corals, kelps, or bivalves. Because most sponges settle and grow slowly their life history is virtually unstudied. The assumption of relative stasis of the Antarctic seafloor community is common, and this project will shatter this paradigm by documenting a dramatic episodic event. Finally, the project takes advantage of old transects from the 1960s and 1970s and compares them with extensive 2010 surveys of the same habitats and sometimes the same intact transect lines, offering a long-term perspective of community change. The investigators will publish these results in peer-reviewed journals, give presentations to the general public and will involve students from local outreach programs, high schools, and undergraduates at UCSD to help with the analysis.	not-provided

From October 2019 to January 2020, three Seagliders were deployed near Guam (14°N 144°E). The Seaglider is an autonomous profiler measuring salinity and temperature in the upper ocean. The three gliders sampled in an adaptive formation to capture the patchiness of the rain and the corresponding oceanic response in real time. The location was chosen because of the likelihood of intense tropical rain events and the availability of a NEXRAD (S-band) rain radar at the Guam Airport. Spacing between gliders varies from 1 to 60 km. Data samples are gridded by profile and on regular depth bins from 0 to 1000 m. The time interval between profiles was about 3 hours, and they are typically about 1.5 km apart. These profiles are available at Level 2 (basic gridding) and Level 3 (despiked and interpolated). All Seaglider data files are in netCDF format with standards compliant metadata. The project was led by a team from the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington.	not-provided

USAP-1543498.v1	A Full Lifecycle Approach to Understanding Adélie Penguin Response to Changing Pack Ice Conditions in the Ross Sea	AMD_USAPDC	2016-06-01		165, -78, -150, -60	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C2532074621-AMD_USAPDC.json	"The Ross Sea region of the Southern Ocean is experiencing growing sea ice cover in both extent and duration. These trends contrast those of the well-studied, western Antarctic Peninsula area, where sea ice has been disappearing. Unlike the latter, little is known about how expanding sea ice coverage might affect the regional Antarctic marine ecosystem. This project aims to better understand some of the potential effects of the changing ice conditions on the marine ecosystem using the widely-recognized indicator species - the Adélie Penguin. A four-year effort will build on previous results spanning 19 seasons at Ross Island to explore how successes or failures in each part of the penguin's annual cycle are effected by ice conditions and how these carry over to the next annual recruitment cycle, especially with respect to the penguin's condition upon arrival in the spring. Education and public outreach activities will continually be promoted through the PenguinCam and PenguinScience websites (sites with greater than 1 million hits a month) and ""NestCheck"" (a site that is logged-on by >300 classrooms annually that allows students to follow penguin families in their breeding efforts). To encourage students in pursuing educational and career pathways in the Science Technology Engineering and Math fields, the project will also provide stories from the field in a Penguin Journal, develop classroom-ready activities aligned with New Generation Science Standards, increase the availability of instructional presentations as powerpoint files and short webisodes. The project will provide additional outreach activities through local, state and national speaking engagements about penguins, Antarctic science and climate change. The annual outreach efforts are aimed at reaching over 15,000 students through the website, 300 teachers through presentations and workshops, and 500 persons in the general public. The project also will train four interns (undergraduate and graduate level), two post-doctoral researchers, and a science writer/photographer. <br/><br/>The project will accomplish three major goals, all of which relate to how Adélie Penguins adapt to, or cope with environmental change. Specifically the project seeks to determine 1) how changing winter sea ice conditions in the Ross Sea region affect penguin migration, behavior and survival and alter the carry-over effects (COEs) to subsequent reproduction; 2) the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors influencing COEs over multiple years of an individual's lifetime; and 3) how local environmental change may affect population change via impacts to nesting habitat, interacting with individual quality and COEs. Retrospective analyses will be conducted using 19 years of colony based data and collect additional information on individually marked, known-age and known-history penguins, from new recruits to possibly senescent individuals. Four years of new information will be gained from efforts based at two colonies (Cape Royds and Crozier), using radio frequency identification tags to automatically collect data on breeding and foraging effort of marked, known-history birds to explore penguin response to resource availability within the colony as well as between colonies (mates, nesting material, habitat availability). Additional geolocation/time-depth recorders will be used to investigate travels and foraging during winter of these birds. The combined efforts will allow an assessment of the effects of penguin behavior/success in one season on its behavior in the next (e.g. how does winter behavior affect arrival time and body condition on subsequent breeding). It is at the individual level that penguins are responding successfully, or not, to ongoing marine habitat change in the Ross Sea region."	not-provided
USAP-1643722.v1	A High Resolution Atmospheric Methane Record from the South Pole Ice Core	AMD_USAPDC	2017-02-01	2019-01-31	180, -90, 180, -90	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C2534799946-AMD_USAPDC.json	This award supports a project to measure the concentration of the gas methane in air trapped in an ice core collected from the South Pole. The data will provide an age scale (age as a function of depth) by matching the South Pole methane changes with similar data from other ice cores for which the age vs. depth relationship is well known. The ages provided will allow all other gas measurements made on the South Pole core (by the PI and other NSF supported investigators) to be interpreted accurately as a function of time. This is critical because a major goal of the South Pole coring project is to understand the history of rare gases in the atmosphere like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ethane, propane, methyl chloride, and methyl bromide. Relatively little is known about what controls these gases in the atmosphere despite their importance to atmospheric chemistry and climate. Undergraduate assistants will work on the project and be introduced to independent research through their work. The PI will continue visits to local middle schools to introduce students to polar science, and other outreach activities (e.g. laboratory tours, talks to local civic or professional organizations) as part of the project.     Methane concentrations from a major portion (2 depth intervals, excluding the brittle ice-zone which is being measured at Penn State University) of the new South Pole ice core will be used to create a gas chronology by matching the new South Pole ice core record with that from the well-dated WAIS Divide ice core record. In combination with measurements made at Penn State, this will provide gas dating for the entire 50,000-year record. Correlation will be made using a simple but powerful mid-point method that has been previously demonstrated, and other methods of matching records will be explored. The intellectual merit of this work is that the gas chronology will be a fundamental component of this ice core project, and will be used by the PI and other investigators for dating records of atmospheric composition, and determining the gas age-ice age difference independently of glaciological models, which will constrain processes that affected firn densification in the past. The methane data will also provide direct stratigraphic markers of important perturbations to global biogeochemical cycles (e.g., rapid methane variations synchronous with abrupt warming and cooling in the Northern Hemisphere) that will tie other ice core gas records directly to those perturbations. A record of the total air content will also be produced as a by-product of the methane measurements and will contribute to understanding of this parameter. The broader impacts include that the work will provide a fundamental data set for the South Pole ice core project and the age scale (or variants of it) will be used by all other investigators working on gas records from the core. The project will employ an undergraduate assistant(s) in both years who will conduct an undergraduate research project which will be part of the student's senior thesis or other research paper. The project will also offer at least one research position for the Oregon State University Summer REU site program. Visits to local middle schools, and other outreach activities (e.g. laboratory tours, talks to local civic or professional organizations) will also be part of the project.	not-provided

For a subset of the colonies, population estimates derived from high-resolution satellite images will be compared with those determined by aerial surveys - these results have been uploaded to MAPPPD (penguinmap.com) and are freely available for use. This validated information will be used to determine population estimates for all emperor penguin colonies through iterations of supervised classification and maximum likelihood calculations on the high-resolution imagery. The effect of spatial, geophysical, and environmental variables on population size and decadal-scale trends will be assessed using generalized linear models. This research will result in a first ever empirical result for emperor penguin population trends and habitat suitability, and will leverage currently-funded NSF infrastructure and hosting sites to publish results in near-real time to the public.	not-provided

The changing Antarctic ice sheets and Southern Ocean are large, complex systems that require cutting edge technology to do cutting edge research, with remote technology becoming increasingly useful and even necessary to monitor changes at sufficient spatial and temporal scales. Antarctic science also often involves large data-transfer needs not currently met by existing satellite communication infrastructure. This workshop will gather representatives from across Antarctic science disciplinesfrom astronomy to zoologyas well as research and education networking experts to explore the scientific advances that would be enabled through dramatically increased real-time network connectivity, and also consider opportunities for subsea cable instrumentation.  This workshop will assess the importance of a subsea fiber optic cable for high-capacity real-time connectivity in the US Antarctic Program, which is at the forefront of some of the greatest climate-related challenges facing our planet. The workshop will: (1) document unmet or poorly met current scientific and logistic needs for connectivity; (2) explore connectivity needs for planned future research and note the scientific advances that would be possible if the full value of modern cyberinfrastructure-empowered research could be brought to the Antarctic research community; and (3) identify scientific opportunities in planning a fully instrumented communication cable as a scientific observatory. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the workshop will be hosted and streamed online. While the workshop will be limited to invited personnel in order to facilitate a collaborative working environment, broad community input will be sought via survey and via comment on draft outputs. A workshop summary document and report will be delivered to NSF. Increasing US Antarctic connectivity by orders of magnitude will be transformative for science and logistics, and it may well usher in a new era of Antarctic science that is more accessible, efficient and sustainable.  This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.	not-provided

Bavay, T. Grünewald, M. Lehning, Advances in Water Resources __55__, 4-16, 2013    A model study on the impact of climate change on snow cover and runoff has been conducted for the Swiss Canton of Graubünden. The model Alpine3D has been forced with the data from 35 Automatic Weather Stations in order to investigate snow and runoff dynamics for the current climate. The data set has then been modified to reflect climate change as predicted for the 2021-2050 and 2070-2095 periods from an ensemble of regional climate models.    The predicted changes in snow cover will be moderate for 2021-2050 and become drastic in the second half of the century. Towards the end of the century the snow cover changes will roughly be equivalent to an elevation shift of 800 m. Seasonal snow water equivalents will decrease by one to two thirds and snow seasons will be shortened by five to nine weeks in 2095.    Small, higher elevation catchments will show more winter runoff, earlier spring melt peaks and reduced summer runoff. Where glacierized areas exist, the transitional increase in glacier melt will initially offset losses from snow melt. Larger catchments, which reach lower elevations will show much smaller changes since they are already dominated by summer precipitation."	not-provided

A fundamental use of ASAS data is to characterize and understand the directional variability in solar energy scattered by various land surface cover types (e.g.,crops, forests, prairie grass, snow, or bare soil). The sensor's Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function determines the variation in the reflectance of a surface as a function of both the view zenith angle and solar illumination angle.  The ASAS sensor is a hyperspectral, multiangle, airborne remote sensing instrument maintained and operated by the Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The ASAS instrument is mounted on the underside of either NASA C-130 or NASA P-3 aircraft and is capable of off-nadir pointing from approximately 70 degrees forward to 55 degrees aft along the direction of flight. The aircraft is flown at an altitude of 5000 - 6000 meters (approximately 16,000 - 20,000 ft.).  Data in the ASAS collection primarily cover areas over the continental United States, but some ASAS data are also available over areas in Canada and western Africa. The ASAS data were collected between 1988 and 1994.	not-provided

Since 2001, these stereo pairs have been used to produce single-scene (60- x 60-kilomenter (km)) digital elevation models (DEM) having vertical (root-mean-squared-error) accuracies generally between 10- and 25-meters (m).   The methodology used by Japan's Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) to produce the ASTER GDEM involves automated processing of the entire ASTER Level-1A archive.  Stereo-correlation is used to produce over one million individual scene-based ASTER DEMs, to which cloud masking is applied to remove cloudy pixels.  All cloud-screened DEMS are stacked and residual bad values and outliers are removed.  Selected data are averaged to create final pixel values, and residual anomalies are corrected before partitioning the data into 1 degree (°) x 1° tiles.  The ASTER GDEM covers land surfaces between 83°N and 83°S and is comprised of 22,702 tiles.  Tiles that contain at least 0.01% land area are included.  The ASTER GDEM is distributed as Geographic Tagged Image File Format (GeoTIFF) files with geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude).  The data are posted on a  1 arc-second (approximately 30–m at the equator) grid and referenced to the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84)/ 1996 Earth Gravitational Model (EGM96) geoid.	not-provided

The total size covering Europe is 4100 samples by 4300 lines. Within 24 hours of acquiring data from the satellite, day-time and night-time LSTs are calculated. In general, the products utilise data from all six of the passes that the satellite makes over Europe in each 24 hour period. For the daily day-time LST maps, the compositing criterion for the three day-time passes is maximum NDVI value and for daily night-time LST maps, the criterion is the maximum night-time LST value of the three night-time passes. Weekly and monthly day-time or night-time LST composite products are also produced by averaging daily day-time or daily night-time LST values, respectively. The range of LST values is scaled between –39.5°C and +87°C with a radiometric resolution of 0.5°C. A value of –40°C is used for water. Clouds are masked out as bad values.

The initiative links the recently developed Swiss Climate Change Scenarios CH2011 with an evolving base of quantitative impact models. The use of a common climate data set across disciplines and research groups sets a high standard of consistency and comparability of results. Impact studies explore the wide range of climatic changes in temperature and precipitation projected in CH2011 for the 21st century, which vary with the assumed global level of greenhouse gases, the time horizon, the underlying climate model, and the geographical region within Switzerland. The differences among climate projections are considered using three greenhouse gas scenarios, three future time periods in the 21st century, and three climate uncertainty levels (Figure 1). Impacts are shown with respect to the reference period 1980-2009 of CH2011, and add to any impacts that have already emerged as a result of earlier climate change.    # Experimental Setup    Future snow cover changes are simulated with the physics-based model Alpine3D (Lehning et al., 2006). It is applied to two regions: The canton of Graubünden and the Aare catchment. These domains are modeled with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a resolution of 200 m × 200 m. This defines the simulation grid that has to be filled with land cover data and downscaled meteorological input data for each cell for the time period of interest at hourly resolution. The reference data set consists of automatic weather station data. All meteorological input parameters are spatially interpolated to the simulation grid. The reference period comprises only thirteen years (1999–2012), because the number of available high elevation weather stations for earlier times is not sufficient to achieve unbiased distribution of the observations with elevation. The model uses projected temperature and precipitation changes for all greenhouse gas scenarios (A1B, A2, and RCP3PD) and CH2011 time periods (2035, 2060, and 2085).    # Data    Snow cover changes are projected to be relatively small in the near term (2035) (Figure 5.1 top), in particular at higher elevations above 2000 m asl. As shown by Bavay et al. (2013) the spread in projected snow cover for this period is greater between different climate model chains (Chapter 3) than between the reference period and the model chain exhibiting the most moderate change. In the 2085 period much larger changes with the potential to fundamentally transform the snow dominated alpine area become apparent (Figure 5.1 bottom). These changes include a shortening of the snow season by 5–9 weeks for the A1B scenario. This is roughly equivalent to an elevation shift of 400–800 m. The slight increase of winter precipitation and therefore snow fall projected in the CH2011 scenarios (with high associated uncertainty) can no longer compensate for the effect of increasing winter temperatures even at high elevations. In terms of Snow Water Equivalents (SWE), the projected reduction is up to two thirds toward the end of the century (2085). A continuous snow cover will be restricted to a shorter time period and/or to regions at increasingly high elevation. In Bern, for example, the number of days per year with at least 5 cm snow depth will decrease by 90% from now 20 days to only 2 days on average.  	not-provided

Prior to 1995, the MAS was deployed on the NASA's ER-2 and C-130 aircraft platforms using a 12-channel, 8-bit data system that somewhat constrained the full benefit of having a 50-channel scanning spectrometer. Beginning in January 1995, a 50-channel, 16-bit digitizer was used on the ER-2 platform, which greatly enhanced the capability of MAS to simulate MODIS data over a wide range of environmental conditions. Recently, it has undergone extensive upgrades to the optics and other components. New detectors have been installed and the spectral bands have been streamlined. The eMAS instrument is now a 38-channel instrument, sensing in the range from 0.445 to 13.844 um.

The European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) is producing SST products in near real time from GOES-16 in the Eastern position. GOES-16 Imager level 1 data are acquired at Meteo-France/Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) through the EUMETSAT/EUMETCAST system. The new GOES-East platform (GOES-16) enables daytime SST calculations (whereas, previously, GOES East SST was restricted to nighttime conditions). The GOES-16 SST is derived from three-bands (centered at 8.4, 10.3, and 12.3 um) algorithm. The ABI split-window configuration features three bands instead of the two found in heritage sensors. This offers additional potential but also may present a challenge if the two end bands centered at 10.3 and 12.3 um are pushed too far in the absorption lines. The 8.5-um is used in conjunction with the 10.3-um and 12.3-um bands for improved thin cirrus detection as well as for better atmospheric moisture correction in relatively dry atmospheres.  Atmospheric profiles of water vapor and temperature from a numerical weather prediction model, together with a radiative transfer model, are used to correct the multispectral algorithm for regional and seasonal biases due to changing atmospheric conditions. Each 30-minute observation interval is processed at full satellite resolution. The operational products are then produced by remapping over a 0.05-degree regular grid (60S-60N and 135W-15W) SST fields obtained by aggregating 30-minute SST data available in one-hour time, and the priority being given to the value the closest in time to the product nominal hour.

The TRMM is a joint venture between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to measure precipitation, water vapor, SST and wind in the global tropical regions and was launched in November 1997. The TRMM satellite travels west to east in a 402 km altitude semi-equatorial precessing orbit that results in day-to-day changes in the observation time of any given earth location between 38S and 38N. In contrast to infrared SST observations, microwave retrievals can be measured through most clouds, and are also insensitive to water vapor and aerosols.  Remote Sensing Systems is the producer of these gridded TMI SST data for the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Project. Although the product designation is ""L2P_GRIDDED"" it is in actuality a Level 3 Collated (L3C) product as defined in the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 2.0. Its ""L2P_GRIDDED"" name derives from a deprecated specification in the early Pilot Project phase of GHRSST (pre 2008) and has remained for file naming continuity. In this dataset, both ascending (daytime) and descending (daytime) gridded orbital passes on packaged into the same daily file."	not-provided
gov.noaa.nodc:GHRSST-VIIRS_NPP-NAVO-L2P.v3.0	GHRSST Level 2P 1 m Depth Global Sea Surface Temperature version 3.0 from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi NPP satellite (GDS version 2)	GHRSSTCWIC	2013-06-28		-180, -90, 180, 90	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C2213644303-GHRSSTCWIC.json	A global Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 2P dataset based on retrievals from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This sensor resides on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi_NPP) satellite launched on 28 October 2011. VIIRS is a whiskbroom scanning radiometer which takes measurements in the cross-track direction within a field of regard of 112.56 degrees using 16 detectors and a double-sided mirror assembly. At a nominal altitude of 829 km, the swath width is 3060 km, providing full daily coverage both on the day and night side of the Earth.  The VIIRS instrument is a 22-band, multi-spectral scanning radiometer that builds on the heritage of the MODIS, AVHRR and SeaWiFS sensors for sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean color. For the infrared bands for SST the effective pixel size is 750 meters at nadir and the pixel size variation across the swath is constrained to no more than 1600 meters at the edge of the swath.  This L2P SST v3.0 is upgraded from the v2.0 with several significant improvements in processing algorithms, including contamination detection, cloud detection, and data format upgrades.  It contains the global near daily-coverage Sea Surface Temperature at 1-meter depth with 750 m (along) x 750 m (cross) spatial resolution in swath coordinates.  Each netCDF file has 768 x 3200 pixels in size, in compliance with the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 2 format specifications.	not-provided

""‘Latent reserves’: a hidden treasure in National Forest Inventories"" (2020) *Journal of Ecology*.           **'Latent reserves'** are defined as plots in National Forest Inventories (NFI) that have been free of human influence for >40 to >70 years. They can be used to investigate and acquire a deeper understanding of attributes and processes of near-natural forests using existing long-term data. To determine which NFI sample plots could be considered ‘latent reserves’, criteria were defined based on the information available in the Swiss NFI database:           * Shrub forests were excluded.  * Plots must have been free of any kind of management, including salvage logging or sanitary cuts, for a minimum amount of time. Thresholds of 40, 50, 60 and 70 years without intervention were tested.  * To ensure that species composition was not influenced by past management, plots where potential vegetation was classified as deciduous by Ellenberg & Klötzli (1972) had to have an observed proportion of deciduous trees matching the theoretical proportion expected in a natural deciduous forest, as defined by Kienast, Brzeziecki, & Wildi (1994).  * Plots had to originate from natural regeneration.   * Intensive livestock grazing must never have occurred on the plots.          The tables stored here were derived from the first, second and third campaigns of the Swiss NFI.

It was calibrated against satellite sea ice records and used to reconstruct sea ice extent prior to the satellite era. The following is taken from the abstract of the paper (Curran et al., 2003).   The instrumental record of Antarctic sea ice in recent decades does not reveal a clear signature of warming despite observational evidence from coastal Antarctica. This work shows a significant correlation (P less than 0.002) between methanesulphonic acid (MSA) concentrations from a Law Dome ice core and 22 years of satellite-derived sea ice extent (SIE) for the 80 degrees E to 140 degrees E sector.  Applying this instrumental calibration to longer term MSA data (1841 to 1995 A.D.) suggests that there has been a 20% decline in SIE since about 1950. The decline is not uniform, showing large cyclical variations, with periods of about 11 years, that confuse trend detection over the relatively short satellite era.  This work was completed as part of ASAC project 757 (ASAC_757)."	not-provided
mbs_wilhelm_msa_hooh.v1	15 year Wilhelm II Land MSA and HOOH shallow ice core record from Mount Brown South (MBS)	AU_AADC	1984-01-01	1998-12-31	86.082, -69.13, 86.084, -69.12	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1214313640-AU_AADC.json	This work presents results from a short firn core spanning 15 years collected from near Mount Brown, Wilhelm II Land, East Antarctica. Variations of methanesulphonic acid (MSA) at Mount Brown were positively correlated with sea-ice extent from the coastal region surrounding Mount Brown (60-1208 E) and from around the entire Antarctic coast (0-3608 E). Previous results from Law Dome identified this MSA-sea-ice relationship and proposed it as an Antarctic sea-ice proxy (Curran and others, 2003), with the strongest results found for the local Law Dome region. Our data provide supporting evidence for the Law Dome proxy (at another site in East Antarctica), but a deeper Mount Brown ice core is required to confirm the sea-ice decline suggested by Curran and others (2003). Results also indicate that this deeper record may also provide a more circum-Antarctic sea-ice proxy.  This work was completed as part of ASAC project 757 (ASAC_757).	not-provided

The goal of the product is to provide the user with actual Sea Surface Temperature (SST) maps in a defined format easy to access with the highest possible reliability on the thematic quality. After a phase of definition, the operational production chain was launched in March 1993 covering the entire Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Since then, daily, weekly, and monthly data sets have been available until September 13, 1994, when the AVHRR on board the NOAA-11 spacecraft failed. The production of daily, weekly and monthly SST maps was resumed in February, 1995, based on NOAA-14 AVHRR data. The NOAA-14 AVHRR sensor became some technical difficulties, so the generation was stopped on October 3, 2001. Since March 2002, NOAA-16 AVHRR SST maps are available again. With the beginning of January 2004, the data of AVHRR on board of NOAA-16 exhibited some anormal features showing strips in the scenes. Facing the “bar coded” images of NOAA16-AVHRR which occurred first in September 2003, continued in January 2004 for the second time and appeared in April 2004 again, DFD has decided to stop the reception of NOAA16 data on April 6th, 2004, and to start the reception of NOAA-17 data on this day. On April 7th, 2004, the production of all former NOAA16-AVHRR products as e.g. the SST composites was successully established. NOAA-17 is an AM sensor which passes central Europe about 2 hours earlier than NOAA-16 (about 10:00 UTC instead of 12:00 UTC for NOAA-16). In spring 2007, the communication system of NOAA-17 has degraded or is operating with limitations. Therefore, DFD has decided to shift the production of higher level products (NDVI, LST and SST) from NOAA-17 to NOAA-18 in April 2007. In order to test the performance of our processing chains, we processed simultaneously all NOAA-17 and NOAA-18 data from January 1st, 2007 till March 29th, 2007. All products are be available via EOWEB. Please remember that NOAA-18 is a PM sensor which passes central Europe about 1.5 hours later than NOAA-17 (about 11:30 UTC instead of 10:00 UTC for NOAA17). The SST product is intended for climate modelers, oceanographers, and all geo science-related disciplines dealing with ocean surface parameters. In addition, SST maps covering the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the Western Atlantic equivalent to the Mediterranean MCSST maps are available since August 1994. The most important aspects of the MCSST maps are a) correct image registration and b) reasonable cloud screening to ensure that only cloud free pixels are taken for the later processing and compositing c) for deriving MCSST, only channel 4 and 5 are used.. The SST product consists of one 8 bit channel. For additional information, please see: https://wdc.dlr.de/sensors/avhrr/	proprietary

The total size covering Europe is 4100 samples by 4300 lines. Within 24 hours of acquiring data from the satellite, day-time and night-time LSTs are calculated. In general, the products utilise data from all six of the passes that the satellite makes over Europe in each 24 hour period. For the daily day-time LST maps, the compositing criterion for the three day-time passes is maximum NDVI value and for daily night-time LST maps, the criterion is the maximum night-time LST value of the three night-time passes. Weekly and monthly day-time or night-time LST composite products are also produced by averaging daily day-time or daily night-time LST values, respectively. The range of LST values is scaled between –39.5°C and +87°C with a radiometric resolution of 0.5°C. A value of –40°C is used for water. Clouds are masked out as bad values.

This dataset provides AirSWOT Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar data products collected from an airborne platform over parts of Alaska and Canada during the period 2017-07-09 to 2017-08-17. Flights targeted specific surface water features, including rivers, lakes, ponds, and wetlands in the ABoVE domain. The radar data include six products: elevation (above the WGS84 ellipsoid), incidence angle, magnitude (backscatter), interferometric correlation (coherence), DHDPHI (incidence angle dependent height sensitivity), and error (estimated height random error, 1-sigma standard deviation). The flight lines were selected to span a full spectrum of permafrost conditions (permafrost-free to continuous permafrost, low to high ground ice content), ecosystems, climatic regions, topographic relief, and geological substrates across the ABoVE domain to investigate surface water responses to thawing permafrost and spatial and temporal variability in terrestrial water storage by measuring elevation and extent of surface waters. The data are provided in two forms: 1) the original output (outer-swath products only) at 3.6 m2 resolution in UTM coordinates from the AirSWOT processing group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and 2) the ABoVE Projection at 3.6 m2 resolution, clipped to the ABoVE reference grid tiles using the C grid.	proprietary

The masks and maps were derived from georeferenced three-band orthomosaics generated from individual images collected during the flights and a semi-automated water classification algorithm based on the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). In total, 3,167 km2 of open water were mapped from 23,380 km2 of flight lines spanning 23 degrees of latitude. Detected water body sizes range from 40 m2 to 15 km2. The image tiles were georeferenced using manually selected ground control points (GCPs). Comparison with manually digitized open water boundaries yields an overall open-water classification accuracy of 98.0%.	proprietary

Data collection for this product is complete.    ACCLIP is an international, multi-organizational suborbital campaign that aims to study aerosols and chemical transport that is associated with the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) in the Western Pacific region from 15 July 2022 to 31 August 2022. The ASM is the largest meteorological pattern in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the summer and is associated with persistent convection and large anticyclonic flow patterns in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). This leads to significant enhancements in the UTLS of trace species that originate from pollution or biomass burning. Convection connected to the ASM occurs over South, Southeast, and East Asia, a region with complex and rapidly changing emissions due to its high population density and economic growth. Pollution that reaches the UTLS from this region can have significant effects on the climate and chemistry of the atmosphere, making it important to have an accurate representation and understanding of ASM transport, chemical, and microphysical processes for chemistry-climate models to characterize these interactions and for predicting future impacts on climate. The ACCLIP campaign is conducted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) with the primary goal of investigating the impacts of Asian gas and aerosol emissions on global chemistry and climate. The NASA WB-57 and NCAR G-V aircraft are outfitted with state-of-the-art sensors to accomplish this. ACCLIP seeks to address four scientific objectives related to its main goal. The first is to investigate the transport pathways of ASM uplifted air from inside of the anticyclone to the global UTLS. Another objective is to sample the chemical content of air processed in the ASM in order to quantify the role of the ASM in transporting chemically active species and short-lived climate forcing agents to the UTLS to determine their impact on stratospheric ozone chemistry and global climate. Third, information is obtained on aerosol size, mass, and chemical composition that is necessary for determining the radiative effects of the ASM to constrain models of aerosol formation and for contrasting the organic-rich ASM UTLS aerosol population with that of the background aerosols. Last, ACCLIP seeks to measure the water vapor distribution associated with the monsoon dynamical structure to evaluate transport across the tropopause and determine the role of the ASM in water vapor transport in the stratosphere.	proprietary

During Fall 2017, the Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar (ACEPOL) campaign, jointly sponsored by NASA and the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON), performed aerosol and cloud measurements over the United States from the NASA high altitude ER-2 aircraft. Six instruments were deployed on the aircraft. Four of these instruments were multi-angle polarimeters: the Airborne Hyper Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (AirHARP), the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI), the Airborne Spectrometer for Planetary Exploration (SPEX Airborne) and the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). The other two instruments were lidars: the High Spectral Resolution Lidar 2 (HSRL-2) and the Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL). The ACEPOL operation was based at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale California, which enabled observations of a wide variety of scene types, including urban, desert, forest, coastal ocean and agricultural areas, with clear, cloudy, polluted and pristine atmospheric conditions. The primary goal of ACEPOL was to assess the capabilities of the different polarimeters for retrieval of aerosol and cloud microphysical and optical parameters, as well as their capabilities to derive aerosol layer height (near-UV polarimetry, O2 A-band). ACEPOL also focused on the development and evaluation of aerosol retrieval algorithms that combine data from both active (lidar) and passive (polarimeter) instruments. ACEPOL data are appropriate for algorithm development and testing, instrument intercomparison, and investigations of active and passive instrument data fusion, which make them valuable resources for remote sensing communities as they prepare for the next generation of spaceborne MAP and lidar missions.	proprietary

After the OCO-2 launch,  ""ACOS"" data are still produced and improved, using approaches applied to the OCO-2 spectra.  The ""ACOS"" data set contains Carbon Dioxide (CO2) column averaged dry air mole fraction for all soundings for which retrieval was attempted. These are the highest-level products made available by the OCO Project, using TANSO-FTS spectral radiances, and algorithm build version 7.3.

An important enhancement in Level1B will address the degradation in the number of quality-passed soundings.   Elimination of many systematic biases, and better agreement with TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network), is expected in Level 2 retrievals. The key changes to the L2 algorithm include scaling the O2-A band spectroscopy (reducing XCO2 bias by 4 or 5 ppm); using interpolation with the instrument lineshape [ ILS ] (reducing XCO2 bias by 1.5 ppm); and fitting a zero level offset to the A-band.

Lastly, users should continue to carefully observe and weigh information from three important flags:         ""warn_level"" - Provides a value that summarizes each sounding's acceptability to a larger set of quality filters.

Marine boundary layer clouds play a critical role in Earth’s energy balance and water cycle. These clouds cover more than 45% of the ocean surface and exert a net cooling effect. The Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western Atlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) project is a five-year project (January 2019-December 2023) that will provide important globally-relevant data about changes in marine boundary layer cloud systems, atmospheric aerosols and multiple feedbacks that warm or cool the climate. ACTIVATE studies the atmosphere over the western North Atlantic and samples its broad range of aerosol, cloud and meteorological conditions using two aircraft, the UC-12 King Air and HU-25 Falcon. The UC-12 King Air will primarily be used for remote sensing measurements while the HU-25 Falcon will contain a comprehensive instrument payload for detailed in-situ measurements of aerosol, cloud properties, and atmospheric state. A few trace gas measurements will also be onboard the HU-25 Falcon for the measurements of pollution traces, which will contribute to airmass classification analysis. A total of 150 coordinated flights over the western North Atlantic are planned through 6 deployments from 2020-2022. The ACTIVATE science observing strategy intensively targets the shallow cumulus cloud regime and aims to collect sufficient statistics over a broad range of aerosol and weather conditions which enables robust characterization of aerosol-cloud-meteorology interactions. This strategy is implemented by two nominal flight patterns: Statistical Survey and Process Study. The statistical survey pattern involves close coordination between the remote sensing and in-situ aircraft to conduct near coincident sampling at and below cloud base as well as above and within cloud top.

The ADAM product is made of gridded monthly mean climatologies over land and ocean surfaces, and of a companion API toolkit that enables the calculation of hyperspectral (at 1 nm resolution over the whole 240-4000 nm spectral range) and multidirectional reflectances (i.e. in any illumination/viewing geometry) depending on user choices.  The ADAM climatologies that feed the ADAM calculation tools are:  For ocean:  monthly chlorophyll concentration derived from SeaWiFS-OrbView-2 (1999-2009); it is used to compute the water column reflectance (which shows large spectral variations in the visible, but is insignificant in the near and mid infrared). monthly wind speed derived from SeaWinds-QuikSCAT-(1999-2009); it is used to calculate the ocean glint reflectance. For land:  monthly normalized surface reflectances in the 7 MODIS narrow spectral bands derived from FondsdeSol processing chain of MOD09A1 products (derived from Aqua and Terra observations), on which relies the modelling of the hyperspectral/multidirectional surface (soil/vegetation/snow) reflectance. uncertainty variance-covariance matrix for the 7 spectral bands associated to the normalized surface reflectance. For sea-ice:  Sea ice pixels (masked in the original MOD09A1 products) have been accounted for by a gap-filling approach relying on the spatial-temporal distribution of sea ice coverage provided by the CryoClim climatology for year 2005.	proprietary

Data are       collected from  selected areas over the conterminous United States,       Alaska, and Hawaii by  NASA ER-2 and NASA C-130B aircraft, operating       from the NASA Ames Research  Center in Moffett Field, California, and by       NASA Learjet aircraft, operating  from Stennis Space Center in Bay St.       Louis, Mississippi.  Limited  international acquisitions also are       available.              In cooperation with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Daedalus        Enterprises,Inc., NASA developed several multispectral sensors.  The       data  acquired from these sensors supports NASA's Airborne Science and       Applications  Program and have been identified as precursors to the       instruments scheduled to  fly on Earth Observing System platforms.              THEMATIC MAPPER SIMULATOR              The Thematic Mapper Simulator (TMS) sensor is a line scanning device          designed for a variety of Earth science applications.  Flown aboard              NASA ER-2 aircraft, the TMS sensor has a nominal Instantaneous Field  of              View of 1.25 milliradians with a ground resolution of 81 feet (25  meters)              at 65,000 feet. The TMS sensor scans at a rate of 12.5 scans per  second              with 716 pixels per scan line.  Swath width is 8.3 nautical miles              (15.4 kilometers) at 65,000 feet while the scanner's Field of View  is              42.5 degrees.                NS-001 MULTISPECTRAL SCANNER               The NS-001multispectral scanner is a line scanning device designed  to              simulate Landsat thematic mapper (TM) sensor performance, including  a              near infrared/short-wave infrared band used in applications similar  to those         of the TM sensor (e.g., Earth resources mapping, vegetation/land  cover          mapping, geologic studies).  Flown aboard NASA C-130B aircraft, the  NS-001       sensor has a nominal Instantaneous Field of View of 2.5 milliradians     with a       ground resolution of 25 feet (7.6 meters) at 10,000 feet.  The sensor has a       variable scan rate (10 to 100 scans per second) with 699  pixels per scan line,       but the available motor drive supply restricts the  maximum stable scan speed       to approximately 85 revolutions per second. A scan rate  of 100 revolutions per       second is possible, but not probable, for short  scan lines; therefore, a       combination of factors, including aircraft  flight requirements and maximum       scan speed, prevent scanner operation below 1,500 feet.  Swath width is 3.9       nautical miles (7.26 kilometers) at 10,000 feet, and the total scan angle or       field of regard for the sensor is 100 degrees, plus or minus 15 degrees for       roll compensation.       THERMAL INFRARED MULTISPECTRAL SCANNER       The Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) sensor is a line  scanning         device originally designed for geologic applications.  Flown aboard NASA       C-130B, NASA ER-2, and NASA Learjet aircraft, the TIMS sensor  has a              nominal Instantaneous Field of View of 2.5 milliradians with a  ground              resolution of 25 feet (7.6 meters) at 10,000 feet.  The sensor has a              selectable scan rate (7.3, 8.7, 12, or 25 scans per second) with 698  pixels          per scan line.  Swath width is 2.6 nautical miles (4.8 kilometers)  at            10,000 feet while the scanner's Field of View is 76.56 degrees.	proprietary

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The HSB level 1B data set contains HSB calibrated and geolocated brightness temperatures in degrees Kelvin. This data set is generated from HSB Level 1A digital numbers (DN), including 4 microwave channels in the 150 - 190 GHz region of the spectrum. A day's worth of data is divided into 240 scenes each of 6 minute duration. For the HSB measurements, an individual scene consists of 135 scanlines containing 90 cross-track footprints; thus there is a total of 135 x 90 = 12,150 footprints per HSB scene, which coincide very closely with the AIRS infrared footprints. HSB is primarily a humidity sounder that provides information on snow/ice cover and precipitation using the 150 GHz window channel, and the coarse distribution of moisture in the troposphere using the 183 GHz channels. Combined with simultaneous measurements from the AIRS and AMSU-A instruments, the calibrated HSB brightness temperatures will be used to initialize the atmospheric moisture profile required for the retrieval of the final AIRS geophysical products. An HSB level 1B daily summary browse product is also available to provide users with a global quick look capability when searching for data of interest.  Summary Browse Products are high-level pictorial representations of AIRS Instrument (AIRS Infrared, AMSU-A and HSB) data designed as an aid to ordering data from the GSFC DISC or EDG. the HSB instrument failed in November of 2003.	proprietary

This data set includes 4 channels in the 0.4 to 1.0 um region of the spectrum. Each day of AIRS data are divided into 240 granules each of 6 minute duration. However, the VIS/NIR granules are only produced in the daytime so there will always be fewer VIS/NIR granules. The primary purpose of the VIS/NIR channels is the detection and flagging of significant inhomogeneities in the infrared field-of-view,which may adversely impact the quality of the temperature and moisture soundings. Therefore the VIS/NIR radiance product has a higher spatial resolution than the Infrared radiance product. Each VIS/NIR scan has 9 alongtrack footprints and 720 across track footprints. For ease in comparing with the infrared product which has 135 along track footprints and 90 across track footprints, the VIS/NIR product has additional dimensions to account for the 9 additional alongtrack and 8 additional across track footprints.	proprietary

AK_AVHRR_Not provided	Alaska AVHRR Twice-Monthly Composites	USGS_LTA STAC Catalog	1990-06-16		-179, 51, -116, 70	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1220565954-USGS_LTA.umm_json	The goal of the Alaska Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer  (AVHRR) project is to compile a time series data set of calibrated,  georegistered  daily observations and twice-monthly maximum normalized difference  vegetation index (NDVI) composites for Alaska's annual growing  season (April-October). This data set has applications for environmental monitoring and for assessing impacts of global climate change.  An Alaska AVHRR data set is comprised of twice-monthly maximum NDVI composites of daily satellite observations.  The NDVI composites  contain 10 bands of information, including AVHRR channels 1-5, maximum NDVI, satellite zenith, solar zenith, and relative azimuth.  The daily   observations, bands 1-9, have been calibrated to reflectance, scaled  to   byte data, and geometrically registered to the Albers Equal-Area  Conic map projection. The 10th band is a pointer to identify the date and  scene ID of  the source daily observation (scene) for each pixel.  The compositing process required each daily overpass to be  registered to a common map projection to ensure that from day to day each 1-km pixel represented the exact same ground location.  The Albers Equal-Area Conic map projection provides for equal area representation, which enables  easy measurement of area throughout the data.  Each daily observation for  the growing season was registered to a base image using image-to-image correlation.  The NDVI data are calculated from the calibrated, geometrically  registered daily observations. The NDVI value is the difference between  near-infrared (AVHRR Channel 2) and visible (AVHRR Channel 1) reflectance values  divided by total measured reflectance.  A maximum NDVI compositing process  was used on the daily observations.  The NDVI is examined pixel by pixel for  each observation during the compositing period to determine and retain  the maximum value.  Often when displaying data covering large areas, such as AVHRR data,  it is beneficial to include an overlay of either familiar linework for  reflectance or polygon data sets to derive statistical summaries of regions.  All of the linework images represent lines in raster format as 1-km cells and  the strata are represented as polygons registered to the AVHRR data.  The  linework and polygon data sets include international boundaries, Alaskan roads  with the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, and a raster polygon mask of the State. 	proprietary

IPY was a collaborative project involving over sixty countries for two years from March 2007 to March 2009. To meet the project goal, world space agencies observed these regions intensively using their own Earth observation satellites. One of these satellites, ALOS - with the PALSAR (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) sensor - observed these regions independently from day-night conditions or weather conditions. Carrying on this initiative, ESA is providing the ALOS PALSAR IPY Antarctica dataset, which consists of full resolution ALOS PALSAR ScanSAR WB1 products (100m spatial resolution) over Antarctica from July 2008 (cycle 21) to December 2008 (Cycle 24) and from May 2009 (cycle 27) to March 2010 (cycle 31).

The radiometers measure brightness temperature at 1.413 GHz in their respective horizontal and vertical polarizations (TH and TV). A scatterometer operating at 1.26 GHz measures ocean backscatter in each footprint that is used for surface roughness corrections in the estimation of salinity. The scatterometer has an approximate 390km swath. Enhancements to the version 5.0 Level 2 data relative to v4.0 include: improvement of the salinity retrieval geophysical model for SST bias, estimates of SSS uncertainties (systematic and random components), and inclusion of a new spiciness variable.	proprietary

The VNIR subsystem includes two independent telescope assemblies that facilitate the generation of stereoscopic data. The band 3 stereo pair is acquired in the spectral range of 0.78 and 0.86 microns with a base-to-height ratio of 0.6 and an intersection angle of 27.7 degrees. There is a time lag of approximately one minute between the acquisition of the nadir and backward images. For a better understanding, refer to this (diagram) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/301/ASTER_Along_Track_Imaging_Geometry.png) depicting the along-track imaging geometry of the ASTER VNIR nadir and backward-viewing sensors.    The accuracy of the new LP DAAC produced DEMs will meet or exceed accuracy specifications set for the ASTER relative DEMs by the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/81/AST14_ATBD.pdf). Users likely will find that the DEMs produced by the new LP DAAC system have accuracies approaching those specified in the ATBD for absolute DEMs. Validation testing has shown that DEMs produced by the new system frequently are more accurate than 25 meters root mean square error (RMSE) in xyz dimensions.    Improvements/Changes from Previous Versions    As of January 2021, the LP DAAC has implemented version 3.0 of the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation ASTER DEM/Ortho (SILCAST) software, which is used to generate the Level 2 on-demand ASTER Orthorectified and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) products (AST14). The updated software provides digital elevation extraction and orthorectification from ASTER L1B input data without needing to enter ground control points or depending on external global DEMs at 30-arc-second resolution (GTOPO30). It utilizes the ephemeris and attitude data derived from both the ASTER instrument and the Terra spacecraft platform. The outputs are geoid height-corrected and waterbodies are automatically detected in this version. Users will notice differences between AST14DEM, AST14DMO, and AST14OTH products ordered before January 2021 (generated with SILCAST V1) and those generated with the updated version of the production software (version 3.0). Differences may include slight elevation changes over different surface types, including waterbodies. Differences have also been observed over cloudy portions of ASTER scenes. Additional information on SILCAST version 3.0 can be found on the  SILCAST website (http://www.silc.co.jp/en/products.html).    Starting June 23, 2021, radiometric calibration coefficient Version 5 (RCC V5) will be applied to newly observed ASTER data and archived ASTER data products. Details regarding RCC V5 are described in the following journal article.

The development of the ASTER GDEM data products is a collaborative effort between National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). The ASTER GDEM data products are created by the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) in Tokyo.     The ASTER GDEM Version 3 data product was created from the automated processing of the entire ASTER Level 1A (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) archive of scenes acquired between March 1, 2000, and November 30, 2013. Stereo correlation was used to produce over one million individual scene based ASTER DEMs, to which cloud masking was applied. All cloud screened DEMs and non-cloud screened DEMs were stacked.

It contains surface emissivity over the land at 90 meters spatial resolution. Estimates of surface emissivity were thus far only derived using surrogates such as land-cover type or vegetation index.     The Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm is used to derive both E (emissivity) and T (surface temperature). The main goals of the TES algorithm include: recovering accurate and precise emissivities for mineral substrates, and estimating accurate and precise surface temperatures especially over vegetation, water and snow.The TES algorithm is executed in the ASTER processing chain following generation of ASTER Level-2 Surface Radiance (TIR). The land-leaving radiance and down-welling irradiance vectors for each pixel are taken in account. Emissivity is estimated using the Normalized Emissivity Method (NEM), and is iteratively compensated for reflected sunlight. The emissivity spectrum is normalized using the average emissivity of each pixel. The minimum-maximum difference (MMD) of the normalized spectrum is calculated and estimates of the minimum emissivity derived through regression analysis. These estimates are used to scale the normalized emissivity and compensate for reflected skylight with the derived refinement of emissivity.

The TES algorithm first estimates emissivity in the TIR channels using the Normalized Emissivity Method (NEM). These estimates are used along with Kirchoff's Law to account for the land-leaving TIR radiance that is due to sky irradiance.

It also provides the downwelling sky irradiance values (in W/m2/µm) for each of the TIR bands. This product is atmospherically corrected, and the surface-leaving radiance is of known accuracy and valid only for clear-sky scenes (cloud-free pixels). This atmospherically corrected product provides the input for generating two other higher-level products: surface spectral emissivity and surface kinetic temperature.    The algorithm to correct atmospheric effects involves two elements: 1) it uses a radiative transfer model which is capable of estimating the magnitude of atmospheric emission, absorption, and scattering. It uses the Moderate Resolution Transmittance Code (MODTRAN) radiative transfer model, which calculates atmospheric transmittance and radiance for frequencies from 0 to 50,000 cmˉ¹ at moderate spectral resolution. 2) It identifies and incorporates all the necessary atmospheric parameters applicable to the location and time for which the measurements require correction.

Changes include:  •	Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) has been added as one of the ancillary ozone inputs for any observations made after May 27, 2020.  The sequence of fallbacks for ozone will remain the same.  •	Toolkit has been updated from Version 5.2.17 to 5.2.20.  Users may notice minor differences between the two versions.  Differences may include minuscule changes in digital numbers around the peripheral of the granule and boundaries of a cloud for Surface Reflectance and Surface Radiance (AST07 and AST09) QA Data Plane depending on the Operating System and libraries being used by the user to process the data.    Additionally, Climatology, which is one of the inputs for Ozone and Moisture, Temperature and Pressures (MTP) will be removed from the Earthdata Order Form.  It has been observed that PGEs generated with Climatology as an input yield noticeable differences statistically during image and spectral analysis.

The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities.  Requirement:    Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years. The CEOS should encourage a member agency to accept the lead role in supporting this activity. CEOS should request all member agencies to support this activity by providing appropriate information and data in a timely manner.

The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities. Requirement:  Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years.

Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 ï¿½m (PM2.5) increases mortality and morbidity. PM2.5 is composed of a mixture of chemical components that vary across space and time. Due to limited hyperlocal data availability, less is known about health risks of PM2.5 components, their U.S.-wide exposure disparities, or which species are driving the biggest intra-urban changes in PM2.5 mass. The national super-learned models were developed across the U.S. for hyperlocal estimation of annual mean elemental carbon, ammonium, nitrate, organic carbon, and sulfate concentrations across 3,535 urban areas at a 50m spatial resolution, and at a 1km resolution for non-urban areas from 2000 to 2019. Using Machine-Learning models (ML), combined with either a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) Ensemble Geographically-Weighted-Averaging (GAM-ENWA) or Super-Learning (SL) and approximately 82 billion predictions across 20 years, hyperlocal super-learned PM2.5 components are now available for further research. The overall R-squared values of 10-fold cross validated models ranged from 0.910 to 0.970 on the training sets for these components, while on the test sets the R-squared values ranged from 0.860 to 0.960. Remarkable spatiotemporal intra-urban and inter-urban variabilities were found in PM2.5 components. The Coordinate Reference System (CRS) for predictions is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) and the Units for the PM2.5 Components are ï¿½g/m^3. The data are provided in RDS tabular format, a file format native to the R programming language, but can also be opened by other languages such as Python.	proprietary

Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 ï¿½m (PM2.5) is a human silent killer of millions worldwide, and contains many trace elements (TEs). Understanding the relative toxicity is largely limited by the lack of data. In this work, ensembles of machine learning models were used to generate approximately 163 billion predictions estimating annual mean PM2.5 TEs, namely Bromine (Br), Calcium (Ca), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Potassium (K), Nickel (Ni), Lead (Pb), Silicon (Si), Vanadium (V), and Zinc (Zn). The monitored data from approximately 600 locations were integrated with more than 160 predictors, such as time and location, satellite observations, composite predictors, meteorological covariates, and many novel land use variables using several machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods. Multiple machine-learning models were developed covering urban areas and non-urban areas.

Derived from a careful review of the environmental literature, these twin goals mirror the priorities expressed by policymakers. Environmental health and ecosystem vitality are gauged using 25 indicators tracked in six well-established policy categories: Environmental Health (Environmental Burden of Disease, Water, and Air Pollution), Air Pollution (effects on ecosystems), Water (effects on ecosystems), Biodiversity and Habitat, Productive Natural Resources (Forestry, Fisheries, and Agriculture), and Climate Change. The 2008 EPI utilizes a proximity-to-target methodology in which performance on each indicator is rated on a 0 to 100 scale (100 represents ï¿½at targetï¿½). By identifying specific targets and measuring how close each country comes to them, the EPI provides a foundation for policy analysis and a context for evaluating performance. Issue-by-issue and aggregate rankings facilitate cross-country comparisons both globally and within relevant peer groups.

BACK GROUND: TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land based Doppler radars, multiple low and high level aircraft equipped with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of surface based instruments for in situ observations. The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to over all COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud and radiation program.  AIRCRAFT INFORMATION: The NASA ER-2 is a high altitude, single pilot aircraft based at Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, and deployed globally in support of a variety of atmospheric research projects. It has a maximum altitude of 70,000 feet (21 km), a range of 3000 nautical miles, a maximum flight duration of 8 hours (nominal 6.5 hours) and a top speed of 410 knots true air speed. The aircraft accommodates about 2700 pounds (1200 kg) of payload.  For the TOGA COARE campaign, the ER-2 payload consisted of a variety of radiometers, a lidar, a conductivity probe and a camera.

INSTRUMENT INFORMATION: The MODIS Airborne Simulator is a visible/infrared imaging radiometer that was mounted, for this campaign, in the right aft wing pod of the ER-2 aircraft. Through cross track scanning to the aircraft direction of flight, the MAS instrument builds a continuous sequence image of the atmosphere surface features under the aircraft. Wavelength channels of the instrument are selected for specific cloud and surface remote sensing applications. Also the channels are those which will be incorporated in measurements by the space borne MODIS instrument. The MAS instrument acquires eleven simultaneous wavelengths with 100 meters or better resolution at the surface.   Principles of Operation: The MAS Spectrometer acquires high spatial resolution imagery in the wavelength range 0.55 to 14.3 microns. A total of 50 spectral bands are available in this range, and currently the digitize is configured before each mission to record in any 12 of these bands during flight. For all pre-1994 MAS missions, the 12-channel digitize was configured with four 10-bit channels and seven 8-bit channels. The MAS spectrometer is mated to a scanner sub-assembly which collects image data with an IFOV of 2.5 mrad, giving a ground resolution of 50 meters from 20,000 meters altitude,and a cross track scan width of 85.92 degrees. A 50 channel digitizer which records all 50 spectral bands at 12 bit resolution became operational in January 1995.   DATA ORGANIZATION Data Format: The archive tapes are created by writing each output data file (1 straight-line flight track) to tape in fixed-length blocks of 16384 bytes, in time ascending order. One end-of-file (EOF) mark is written at the end of the data blocks for each file, and an extra EOF is written at the end of the data on the tape.  The last block of each file has good data at the start of the block and unused bytes (filled with null characters) at the end. Information on the length of the file is encoded in the header when the file is created. No file name,protection, or ownership information is written onto the archive tape. All information necessary to identify the file is stored in the file itself.  Documentation:  In addition to this document, please obtain Volume 3, MODIS Airborne Simulator Level 1B Data Users Guide, resident in this directory in postscript file MAS_Usr_Guide.ps.   Browse Products: There are 2 GIF image files per flight line, named 93ddd??v.gif and 93ddd??i.gif, where 93 is the year, ddd the Julian day of the flight, ?? the flight line number, and v or i, indicating respectively visible (VIS) or Infrared (IR) imagery. Images from each flight, accompanied by a flight statistics summary file, reside in a sub directory named with the date of the flight (02feb93) under mas/images.	proprietary

Processing Levels: - Level 1A - Single-look Complex Slant (SCSB and SCSU) : RAW data focused in slant range-azimuth projection, that is the sensor natural acquisition projection; product contains In-Phase and Quadrature of the focused data, weighted and radiometrically equalised.  The processing of the 1A_SCSU product differs from that of the 1A_SCSB product for the following features: a non-weighted processing is performed, which means that windowing isn't applied on the processed bandwidth; radiometric equalisation (in terms of compensation of the range antenna pattern and incidence angle) is not performed; hence only compensation of the antenna transmitter gain and receiver attenuation and range spreading loss is applied.• Level 1B - Detected Ground Multi-look (DGM): product obtained detecting, multi-looking and projecting the Single-look Complex Slant data onto a grid regular in ground. Spotlight Mode products are not multi-looked - Level 1C - Geocoded Ellipsoid Corrected (GEC) and Level 1D - Geocoded Terrain Corrected (GTC): Obtained projecting the Level 1A product onto a regular grid in a chosen cartographic reference system.

CryoSat.products_NA	CryoSat products	ESA STAC Catalog	2010-04-08		-180, -90, 180, 90	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1532648141-ESA.umm_json	CryoSat's primary payload is the SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeter (SIRAL) (https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/instruments/siral) which has extended capabilities to meet the measurement requirements for ice-sheet elevation and sea-ice freeboard.  CryoSat also carries three star trackers for measuring the orientation of the baseline. In addition, a radio receiver called Doppler Orbit and Radio Positioning Integration by Satellite (DORIS) and a small laser retroreflector ensures that CryoSat's position will be accurately tracked.  More detailed information on CryoSat instruments is available on the CryoSat mission page.  The following CryoSat datasets are available and distributed to registered users:  Level 1B and L2 Ice products: FDM, LRM, SAR and SARIn Consolidated Level 2 (GDR): (LRM+SAR+SARIN) consolidated ice products over an orbit Intermediate Level 2 Ice products: LRM, SAR and SARIn L1b and L2 Ocean Products: GOP and IOP CryoTEMPO EOLIS Point Products CryoTEMPO EOLIS Gridded Products  Detailed information concerning each of the above datasets is available in the CryoSat Products Overview (https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/cryosat/products) and in the news item: CryoSat Ocean Products now open to scientific community (https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/cryosat/news/-/asset_publisher/47bD/content/cryosat-ocean-products-now-open-to-scientific-community).  CryoSat Level 1B altimetric products contain time and geo-location information as well as SIRAL measurements in engineering units. Calibration corrections are included and have been applied to the window delay computations. In Offline products, geophysical corrections are computed from Analysis Auxiliary Data Files (ADFs), whereas in FDM products corrections are computed for Forecast ADFs. All corrections are included in the data products and therefore the range can be calculated by taking into account the surface type.  The Offline Level 2 LRM, SAR and SARIn ice altimetric products are generated 30 days after data acquisition and are principally dedicated to glaciologists working on sea-ice and land-ice areas. The Level 2 FDM products are near-real time ocean products, generated 2-3 hours after data acquisition, and fulfill the needs of some ocean operational services. Level 2 products contain the time of measurement, the geo-location and the height of the surface.  IOP and GOP are outputs of the CryoSat Ocean Processor. These products are dedicated to the study of ocean surfaces, and provided specifically for the needs of the oceanographic community. IOP are generated 2-3 days after data sensing acquisition and use the DORIS Preliminary Orbit. GOP are typically generated 30 days after data sensing acquisition and use the DORIS Precise Orbit. Geophysical corrections are computed from the Analysis ADFs, however following the oceanographic convention the corrections are available but not directly applied to the range (as for FDM).  The CryoSat ThEMatic PrOducts (Cryo-TEMPO) projects aim to deliver a new  paradigm of simplified, harmonized, and agile CryoSat-2 products, that are  easily accessible to new communities of non-altimeter experts and end users. The Cryo-TEMPO datasets include dedicated products over five thematic areas, covering Sea Ice, Land Ice, Polar Ocean, Coastal Ocean and Inland Water, together with a novel SWATH product (CryoTEMPO-EOLIS) that exploits CryoSat's SARIn mode over ice sheet margins. The standard Cryo-TEMPO products include fully-traceable uncertainties and use rapidly evolving, state-of-the-art processing dedicated to each thematic area. Throughout the project, the  products will be constantly evolved, and validated by a group of Thematic Users, thus ensuring optimal relevance and impact for the intended target  communities. More information on the Cryo-TEMPO products can be found on the Project Website (http://cryosat.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/tempo/index.html). The CryoTEMPO-EOLIS swath product exploits CryoSat's SARIn mode and the novel Swath processing technique to deliver increased spatial and temporal coverage of time-dependent elevation over land ice, a critical metric for tracking ice mass trends in support to a wide variety of end-users. The CryoTEMPO-EOLIS swath product exploits CryoSat's SARIn mode and the novel Swath processing technique to deliver increased spatial and temporal coverage of time-dependent elevation over land ice, a critical metric for tracking ice mass trends in support to a wide variety of end-users.The dataset consists of systematic reprocessing of the entire CryoSat archive to generate new L2-Swath products, increasing data sampling by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared with the operational L2 ESA product. In addition, the EOLIS dataset is joined with the ESA L2 Point-Of-Closest-Approach to generate monthly DEM (Digital Elevation Model) products. This dataset will further the ability of the community to analyse and understand trends across the Greenland Ice Sheet margin, Antarctica and several mountain glaciers and ice caps around the world.	proprietary

ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).  The ECOSTRESS Swath Attitude and Ephemeris Instantaneous Level 1B Global (ECO_L1B_ATT) Version 2 data product provides both corrected and uncorrected attitude quaternions and spacecraft ephemeris data obtained from the ISS. The data are provided in 1 second intervals, and each product file contains vectors from the duration of the orbit.   The ECO_L1B_ATT Version 2 data product contains layers of attitude and ephemeris data generated by the ISS, which are used to start the geolocation process. These layers also include Earth-centered inertial (ECI) position and velocity, and associated time elements distributed in HDF5 format.    Known Issues: *Cannot perform spatial query on ECO_L1B_ATT in NASA Earthdata Search: ECO_L1B_ATT does not contain spatial attributes, so granules cannot be searched by geographic location. Users should search for ECO_L1B_ATT data products by orbit number instead.  *Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed.  *Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.	proprietary

ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).  The ECOSTRESS Swath Top of Atmosphere Calibrated Radiance Instantaneous L1B Global 70 m (ECO_L1B_RAD) Version 2 data product provides at-sensor calibrated radiance values retrieved for five thermal infrared (TIR) bands operating between 8 and 12.5 µm. Additionally, the digital numbers (DN) for the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band are provided. The TIR bands are spatially co-registered to produce a variable spatial resolution between 70 meters (m) and 90 m at the edge of the swath. The ECO_L1B_RAD data product is provided as swath data and does not contain geolocation information. The corresponding ECO_L1B_GEO (https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L1B_GEO.002) data product is required to georeference the ECO_L1B_RAD data product. The geographic coverage of acquisitions for the ECO_L1B_RAD Version 2 data product extends to areas outside of those indicated on the coverage map.   The ECO_L1B_RAD Version 2 data product contains layers of radiance values for the five TIR bands, DN values for the SWIR band, associated data quality indicators, and ancillary data distributed in HDF5 format. For acquisitions after May 15, 2019, data products contain data values for the 8.785 μm, 10.522 μm, and 12.001 μm (TIR) bands only. The 1.6 μm (SWIR), 8.285 μm (TIR), and 9.060 μm (TIR) bands contain fill values to accommodate direct streaming of data from the ISS.    Known Issues: *Cannot perform spatial query on ECO_L1B_RAD in NASA Earthdata Search: ECO_L1B_RAD does not contain spatial attributes, so granules cannot be searched by geographic location. Users should search for ECO_L1B_RAD data products by orbit number instead.  *Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period.

A machine learning algorithm has been applied to interpolate missing values. For more information on the missing scan filling techniques and outcomes, see Section 3.3.2 of the User Guide.  *Scan overlap: An overlap between ECOSTRESS scans results in a clear line overlap and repeating data.

The ECO_L2_LSTE is provided as swath data and has a spatial resolution of 70 meters (m). The corresponding  ECO_L1B_GEO (https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L1B_GEO.002) data product is required to georeference the ECO_L2_LSTE data product.  The ECO_L2_LSTE Version 2 data product contains layers of LST, emissivity for bands 1 through 5, quality control for LST&E, LST error, emissivity error for bands 1 through 5, wideband emissivity, Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV), cloud mask, and water mask.   For acquisitions between May 15, 2019, and April 28, 2023, data products contain data values for TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 only. TIR bands 1 and 3 contain fill values to accommodate direct streaming of data from the ISS.     Known Issues: *Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.  *Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.  *Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.  	proprietary

Disclaimer  This product is generated to support the EMIT mission objectives of constraining the sign of dust related radiative forcing. Ten mineral types are the core focus of this work: Calcite, Chlorite, Dolomite, Goethite, Gypsum, Hematite, Illite+Muscovite, Kaolinite, Montmorillonite, and Vermiculite. A future product will aggregate these results for use in Earth System Models. Additional minerals are included in this product for transparency but were not the focus of this product. Further validation is required to use these additional mineral maps, particularly in the case of resource exploration. Similarly, the separation of minerals with similar spectral features, such as a fine-grained goethite and hematite, is an area of active research. The results presented here are an initial offering, but the precise categorization is likely to evolve over time, and the limits of what can and cannot be separated on the global scale is still being explored.

ARC reprocesses the ATSR multi-mission archive using new cloud detection and SST retrievals to produce a homogenous record of sea surface temperature. The main ARC objective is to reduce regional biases in retrieved SST to less than 0.1 K for all global oceans while creating a very homogenous record with a stability (lack of drift in the observing system and analysis) of 0.05 K per decade. ARC products are available for ATSR-1, ATSR-2 and AATSR. ARC products are provided in netCDF format and contain data for both the skin SST and the SST estimated for depths of 0.2 and 1.0 m (corresponding approximately to drifter and moored buoy depths). The AATSR estimated depth SSTs are adjusted to a local equatorial crossing time of 10:30 (approximately half an hour after observation), to provide continuity with ATSR-1 and ATSR-2 data.

Because this simulation is intended to serve as a reference Nature Run for Observing System  Simulation Experiments (OSSEs, e.g., Errico et al., 2012) it will be referred to as the 7-km GEOS-5  Nature Run or 7-km G5NR. This simulation has been performed with the Ganymed version of GEOS-  5, more specifically with CVS Tag wmp-Ganymed-4_0_BETA8.  In addition to standard meteorological parameters (wind, temperature, moisture, surface pressure),  this simulation includes 15 aerosol tracers (dust, sea-salt, sulfate, black and organic carbon), O3, CO  and CO2. This model simulation is driven by prescribed sea-surface temperature and sea-ice, as well  as surface emissions and uptake of aerosols and trace gases, including daily volcanic and biomass  burning emissions, biogenic sources and sinks of CO2, and high-resolution inventories of  anthropogenic sources.The simulation is performed at a horizontal resolution of 7 km using a cubed-sphere horizontal  grid with 72 vertical levels, extending up to to 0.01 hPa (~ 80 km). For user convenience, all data  products are generated on two logically rectangular longitude-latitude grids: a full-resolution  0.0625o grid that approximately matches the native cubed-sphere resolution, and another 0.5o  reduced-resolution grid. The majority of the full-resolution data products are instantaneous with  some fields being time-averaged. The reduced-resolution datasets are mostly time-averaged, with  some fields being instantaneous. Hourly data intervals are used for the reduced-resolution datasets,  while 30-minute intervals are used for the full-resolution products. All full-resolution output is on  the model’s native 72-layer hybrid sigma-pressure vertical grid, while the reduced-resolution  output is given on native vertical levels and on 48 pressure surfaces extending up to 0.02 hPa.  Section 4 presents additional details on horizontal and vertical grids. 	proprietary

GEOS FP_1	GEOS Forward Processing	NCCS STAC Catalog	2014-02-20		-180, 90, 179.6875, 90	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1634094157-NCCS.umm_json	The GEOS FP Atmospheric Data Assimilation System (GEOS ADAS) uses an analysis  developed jointly with NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), which  allows the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) to take advantage of the  developments at NCEP and the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA). The  GEOS AGCM uses the finite-volume dynamics (Lin, 2004) integrated with various physics  packages (e.g, Bacmeister et al., 2006), under the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)  including the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) (e.g., Koster et al., 2000). The GSI  analysis is a three-dimensional variational (3DVar) analysis applied in grid-point space to  facilitate the implementation of anisotropic, inhomogeneous covariances (e.g., Wu et al., 2002;  Derber et al., 2003). The GSI implementation for GEOS FP incorporates a set of recursive filters  that produce approximately Gaussian smoothing kernels and isotropic correlation functions.  The GEOS ADAS is documented in Rienecker et al. (2008). More recent updates to the model  are presented in Molod et al. (2011). The GEOS system actively assimilates roughly 2 ´ 106  observations for each analysis, including about 7.5 ´ 105 AIRS radiance data. The input stream  is roughly twice this volume, but because of the large volume, the data are thinned  commensurate with the analysis grid to reduce the computational burden. Data are also rejected  from the analysis through quality control procedures designed to detect, for example, the  presence of cloud.  To minimize the spurious periodic perturbations of the analysis, GEOS FP uses the Incremental  Analysis Update (IAU) technique developed by Bloom et al. (1996).	proprietary

This is a low relief tip of a bedrock  peninsula covered with several meters of glacial drift and reworked raised beach ridges. The measurements are obtained in the site of well developed patterned ground, sorted polygons, where the influence of plants, including thermal insulation and transpiration, is negligible. The 1985-1986 period was average. Mean annual air temperature was -6.6 C, 0.4 C colder than the long-term (1975-1990) mean, but well within the mean variability. Mean winter air temperature is relatively warm (mean of coldest month, February, is -14.6 C). Annual precipitation was 17 % greater than the ong-term mean (372 mm); however, the number of rain-on-snow events was less (3) than average (5.5). Overall, the reference period is close to long-term averages.     A program of automated soil temperature recordings was initiated in the summer of 1984, at a patterned ground field site Thermistors were placed approximately 0.1 m apart in an epoxy-filled PVC rod (18 mm outside diameter), buried in the center of a fine-grained domain of a sorted circle, down to 1.14 m below the ground surface. The data presented here covers 7/1/85-7/1/86, once a day (6 am), at two levels (0.0 m, 1.145 m below surface). The resolution of the thermistors is 0.004 C, and the accuracy is estimated to be 0.02 C near 0 C. Missing data accounts for less than 7 %. The gaps are filled with simple average of the beginning and end of the gap values. For a detailed description of the field site and data analysis see Putkonen (1997) and Hallet and Prestrud (1986).

We use six variations related to the treatment of the atmospheric composition, the calculation of aerosol indirect effects, and ocean model component. Specifically, we test the difference between atmospheric models that have noninteractive composition, where radiatively important aerosols and ozone are prescribed from precomputed decadal averages, and interactive versions where atmospheric chemistry and aerosols are calculated given decadally varying emissions. The impact of the first aerosol indirect effect on clouds is either specified using a simple tuning, or parameterized using a cloud microphysics scheme. We also use two dynamic ocean components: the Russell and HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) which differ significantly in their basic formulations and grid. Results are presented for the climatological means over the satellite era (1980-2004) taken from transient simulations starting from the preindustrial (1850) driven by estimates of appropriate forcings over the 20th Century. Differences in base climate and variability related to the choice of ocean model are large, indicating an important structural uncertainty. The impact of interactive atmospheric composition on the climatology is relatively small except in regions such as the lower stratosphere, where ozone plays an important role, and the tropics, where aerosol changes affect the hydrological cycle and cloud cover. While key improvements over previous versions of the model are evident, these are not uniform across all metrics.	proprietary

Both the original published Vcmax and Jmax values as well as estimates at standard temperature are reported. The maximum rate of carboxylation (Vcmax) and the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax) are primary determinants of photosynthetic rates in plants, and modeled carbon fluxes are highly sensitive to these parameters. Previous studies have shown that Vcmax and Jmax correlate with leaf nitrogen across species and regions, and locally across species with leaf phosphorus and specific leaf area, yet no universal relationship suitable for global-scale models is currently available. These data are suitable for exploring the general relationships of Vcmax and Jmax with each other and with leaf N, P and SLA. This data set contains one *.csv file.	proprietary

It is 1) the microphysical and scattering characteristics of pure aerosol upon which routine retrievals are based; 2) mixtures of pure aerosol to be compared with MISR observations; and 3) likelihood value assigned to each mode geographically. The ACP describes mixtures of up to three component aerosol types from a list of eight components, in varying proportions. ACP component aerosol particle data quality depends on the ACP input data, which are based on aerosol particles described in the literature, and consider MISR-specific sensitivity to particle size, single-scattering albedo, and shape, and shape - roughly: small, medium and large; dirty and clean; spherical and nonspherical [Kahn et al. , 1998; 2001]. Also reported in the ACP are the mixtures of these components used by the retrieval algorithm. The MISR instrument consists of nine pushbroom cameras which measure radiance in four spectral bands. Global coverage is achieved in nine days. The cameras are arranged with one camera pointing toward the nadir, four cameras pointing forward, and four cameras pointing aftward. It takes seven minutes for all nine cameras to view the same surface location. The view angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid, are 0, 26.1, 45.6, 60.0, and 70.5 degrees.

However, for the MODIS L1B 1 km product, the 250 m and 500 m band radiance data and their associated uncertainties have been aggregated to 1km resolution. Thus the entire channel data set is referenced to the same spatial and geolocation scales. Separate L1B products are available for the 250 m channels (MYD02QKM) and 500 m channels (MYD02HKM) that preserve the original resolution of the data.         Spatial resolution for pixels at nadir is 1 km, degrading to 4.8 km in the along-scan direction at the scan extremes. However, thanks to the overlapping of consecutive swaths and respectively pixels there, the resulting resolution at the scan extremes is about 2km.  A 55 degree scanning pattern at the EOS orbit of 705 km results in a 2330km orbital swath width and provides global coverage every one to two days. A single MODIS Level 1B granule will nominally contain a scene built from 203 scans (or swaths) sampled 1354 times in the cross-track direction, corresponding to approximately 5 minutes worth of data. Since an individual MODIS scan (or swath) will contain 10 along-track spatial elements, the scene will be composed of (1354 x 2030) pixels, resulting in a spatial coverage of (2330 km x 2030 km). Due to the  MODIS scan geometry, there will be increasing overlap occurring beyond about 25 degrees scan angle.         To summarize, the MODIS L1B 1 km data product consists of:          1. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (2) 250 m reflected solar bands aggregated to 1km resolution          2. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (5) 500 m reflected solar bands aggregated to 1 km resolution          3. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (13) 1 km reflected solar bands and (16) infrared emissive bands          4. Geolocation subsampled at every 5th pixel across and along track          5. Satellite and solar angles subsampled at the above frequency          6. Comprehensive set of file-level metadata summarizing the spatial, temporal and parameter attributes of the data, as well as auxiliary information pertaining to instrument status and data quality characterization.         The MODIS L1B data are stored in the Earth Observing System Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS) which is an extension of HDF as developed by the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. A typical file size will be approximately 260 MB.

MYD02HKM_6.1NRT	MODIS/Aqua Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 500m - NRT	LANCEMODIS STAC Catalog	2017-10-20		-180, -90, 180, 90	https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1426617060-LANCEMODIS.umm_json	The 500 meter MODIS Level 1B Near Real Time (NRT) data set contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 7 discrete bands located in the 0.45 to 2.20 micron region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These data are generated from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance and in the process converted to geophysical units of W/(m^2 um sr). In addition, the Earth Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) may be determined for these solar reflective bands through knowledge of the solar irradiance (e.g., determined from MODIS solar diffuser data, and from the target illumination geometry).  Additional data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data.  Visible, shortwave infrared, and near infrared measurements are only made during the daytime, while radiances for the thermal infrared region (bands 20-25, 27-36) are measured continuously.  Channel locations for the MODIS 500 meter data are as follows:  Band   Center Wavelength (um)    Primary Use ----   ----------------------    ----------- 1          0.620  - 0.670        Land/Cloud Boundaries 2          0.841  - 0.876        Land/Cloud Boundaries 3          0.459  - 0.479        Land/Cloud Properties 4          0.545  - 0.565        Land/Cloud Properties 5          1.230  - 1.250        Land/Cloud Properties 6          1.628  - 1.652        Land/Cloud Properties 7          2.105  - 2.155        Land/Cloud Properties  Channels 1 and 2 have 250 m resolution, channels 3 through 7 have 500 m resolution. However, for the MODIS L1B 500 m product, the 250 m band radiance data and their associated uncertainties have been aggregated to 500 m resolution. Thus the entire channel data set has been co-registered to the same spatial scale in the 500 m product. Separate L1B products are available for the 250 m resolution channels (MYD02QKM) and 1 km resolution channels (MYD021KM). For the latter product, the 250 m and 500 m channel data (bands 1 through 7) have been aggregated into equivalent 1 km pixel values.  Spatial resolution for pixels at nadir is 500 km, degrading to 2.4 km in the along-scan direction at the scan extremes. However, thanks to the overlapping of consecutive swaths and respectively pixels there, the resulting resolution at the scan extremes is about 1 km. A 55 degree scanning pattern at the EOS orbit of 705 km results in a 2330 km orbital swath width and provides global coverage every one to two days. A single MODIS Level 1B 500 m granule will contain a scene built from 203 scans sampled 2708 times in the cross-track direction, corresponding to approximately 5 minutes worth of data; thus 288 granules will be produced per day. Since an individual MODIS scan will contain 20 along-track spatial elements for the 500 m channels, the scene will be composed of (2708 x 4060) pixels, resulting in a spatial coverage of (2330 km x 2040 km). Due to the MODIS scan geometry, there will be increasing scan overlap beyond about 20 degrees scan angle.  To summarize, the MODIS L1B 500 m data product consists of:  1. Calibrated radiances, uncertainties and number of samples for (2) 250 m reflected solar bands aggregated to 500 m resolution  2. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (5) 500 m reflected solar bands  3. Geolocation for 1km pixels, that must be interpolated to get 500 m pixel locations. For the relationship of 1km pixels to 500m pixels, see the Geolocation ATBD http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/atbd/atbd_mod28_v3.pdf .  4. Calibration data for all channels (scale and offset)  5. Comprehensive set of file-level metadata summarizing the spatial, temporal and parameter  attributes of the data, as well as auxiliary information pertaining to instrument status and data quality characterization   The MODIS L1B 500 m data are stored in the Earth Observing System Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS) which is an extension of HDF as developed by the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. A typical file size will be approximately 170 MB.

For the 500 m product, there are actually seven channels available since the data from the two 250 m channels have been aggregated to 500 m resolution.  Similarly, for the 1 km product, all 36 MODIS channels are available since the data from the two 250 m and five 500 m channels have been aggregated into equivalent 1 km pixel values.  Spatial resolution for pixels at nadir is 250 m, degrading to 1.2 km in the along-scan direction and 0.5 km in the along-track direction for pixels located at the scan extremes. A 55 degree scanning pattern at the EOS orbit of 705 km results in a 2330 km orbital swath width and provides global coverage every one to two days. A single MODIS Level 1B 250 m granule will contain a scene built from 203 scans sampled 5416 times in the cross-track direction, corresponding to approximately 5 minutes worth of data; thus 288 granules will be produced per day. Since an individual MODIS scan will contain 40 along-track spatial elements for the 250 m channels, the scene will be composed of (5416 x 8120) pixels, resulting in a spatial coverage of (2330 km x 2040 km). Due to the MODIS scan geometry, there will be increasing scan overlap beyond about 17 degrees scan angle. To summarize, the MODIS L1B 250 m data product consists of:  1. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (2) 250 m reflected solar bands  2. Subsampled geolocation at every 4th 250 m pixel across and along track, i.e., a geolocation point every kilometer  3.

Every fifth pixel is taken from the MYD021KM product and written out to MYD02SSH. The subsampling starts at the third frame, and at the third line. Here, ""frame"" and ""line"" are naming conventions for pixels along and across the scan, respectively. Since MYD02SSH is a subsampled Level 1B , many things from the Level 1B documentation apply as well. That is, the MYD02SSH data productcontains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 36 bands generated from MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance (MOD 01). The radiance units are in W/(m ^2 um sr). Additional data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data. Visible, shortwave infrared (SWIR), and Near Infrared (NIR) measurements are made during daytime only, while radiances for Thermal Infrared (TIR) are measured continuously.As it's parent, the MYD02SSH is in HDF-EOS format, and all metadata structures and names are preserved for better convenience. However, some relevant changes are made where appropriate, e.g. the dimension mappings are updated to reflect the new one-to-one correspondance between the data and geolocations. The latter is one of the most important differences: in the MYD02SSH, there is no offset between data and geolocation pixels. The spatial coverage is almost similar to that from MYD021KM (nominally it is 2330 by 2030 km, cross-track by along-track, respectively). The MYD02SSH is produced continuously, and thus the processing provides 2-day repeat observations of the Earth with a repeat orbitpattern every 16 days.The shortname for this product is MYD02SSH"	proprietary

MODIS infrared channel radiances are used to derive cloud top temperature, cloud top height, effective emissivity, cloud phase (ice vs. water, opaque vs. non-opaque), and cloud fraction under both daytime and nighttime conditions. MODIS visible radiances are used to derive cloud optical thickness and effective particle radius and cloud shadow effects. Near infrared solar reflected radiance provides additional information in the retrieval of cloud particle phase (ice vs. water, clouds vs. snow).

The algorithm employs a series of visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests to specify confidence levels that an unobstructed view of the Earth's surface is observed.   The Terra MODIS Photovoltaic (PVLWIR) bands 27-30 are known to experience an electronic crosstalk contamination. The influence of the crosstalk has gradually increased over the mission lifetime, causing for example, earth surface features to become prominent in atmospheric band 27, increased detector striping, and long term drift in the radiometric bias of these bands. The drift has compromised the climate quality of C6 Terra MODIS L2 products that depend significantly on these bands, including cloud mask (MOD35), cloud fraction and cloud top properties (MOD06), and total precipitable water (MOD07). A linear crosstalk correction algorithm has been developed and tested by MCST.The electronic crosstalk correction was made to the calibration algorithm for bands 27-30 and implemented into C6.1 operational L1B processing. This implementation greatly improves the performance of the cloud mask.

It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands),and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at various DAACs and has been made available to public since April 2000.  The shortname for this level-3 MODIS aerosol product is MYDAODHD. The Naval Research Laboratory and the University of North Dakota developed this value-added aerosol optical depth dataset based on MODIS Level 2 aerosol products. The MYDAODHD is a gridded product and is specifically designed for quantitative applications including data assimilation and model validation. It is available through LANCE-MODIS. It offers several enhancements over the MODIS Level 2 data on which it is based. These enhancements include stringent filtering to reduce outliers, eliminate cloud contamination, and exclude conditions where aerosol detection is likely to be inaccurate; reduction of systematic biases over land and ocean by empirical corrections; reduction of random variation in AOD values by spatial averaging; quantitative estimation of uncertainty for each AOD data point.  The MxDAODHD granules are produced every six hours, and time-stamped 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 (all times UTC). Each granule includes MODIS observations from +/-3 hours from the timestamp (e.g. 12:00 product includes MODIS data from 09:00-15:00 UTC).

The V8 ozone profile algorithm relies on nadir profiler measurements made in the 250 to 310 nm range, as well as from measurements from the nadir mapper in the 300 to 380 nm range. Ozone mixing ratios are reported at 15 pressure levels between 50 and 0.5 hPa. Additionally, this data product contains measurements of total ozone, UV aerosol index and reflectivities at 331 and 380 nm. Each granule contains data from the daylight portion of each orbit measured for a full day. Spatial coverage is global (-82 to +82 degrees latitude), and there are about 14.5 orbits per day, each has typically 80 profiles. The NP footprint size is 250 km x 250 km. The L2 NP Ozone data are written using the Hierarchical Data Format Version 5 or HDF5.	proprietary

From October 2019 to January 2020, three Seagliders were deployed near Guam (14°N 144°E). The Seaglider is an autonomous profiler measuring salinity and temperature in the upper ocean. The three gliders sampled in an adaptive formation to capture the patchiness of the rain and the corresponding oceanic response in real time. The location was chosen because of the likelihood of intense tropical rain events and the availability of a NEXRAD (S-band) rain radar at the Guam Airport. Spacing between gliders varies from 1 to 60 km. Data samples are gridded by profile and on regular depth bins from 0 to 1000 m. The time interval between profiles was about 3 hours, and they are typically about 1.5 km apart. These profiles are available at Level 2 (basic gridding) and Level 3 (despiked and interpolated).

The ALT was estimated using a remote sensing-based soil process model incorporating global satellite data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) and snow cover extent (SCE), and Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) satellite soil moisture records. The study area covers the majority land area of Alaska except for areas of perennial ice/snow cover or open water. The ALT was defined as the maximum soil thawing depth throughout the year. The mean ALT and mean uncertainty from 2001 to 2015 are also provided.	proprietary

As the instrument flies overhead, each piece of Earth's surface below is successively imaged by all 9 cameras, in each of 4 wavelengths (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). The goal of MISR is to improve our understanding of the fate of sunlight in Earth environment, as well as distinguish different types of clouds, particles and surfaces. Specifically, MISR monitors the monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends in three areas: 1) amount and type of atmospheric particles (aerosols), including those formed by natural sources and by human activities; 2) amounts, types, and heights of clouds, and 3) distribution of land surface cover, including vegetation canopy structure. MISR Geometric Parameters subset for the VBBE region V003 contains the Geometric Parameters which measure the sun and view angles at the reference ellipsoid.	proprietary

The products provide data from all spectral bands (SWIR, NIR, RED, BLUE), the NDVI and auxiliary data on image acquisition parameters. The VEGETATION system allows operational and near real-time applications, at global, continental and regional scales, in very broad environmentally and socio-economically critical fields. The VEGETATION instrument is operational since April 1998, first with VGT1, from March 2003 onwards, with VGT2.

The Deep Blue algorithm draws its heritage from previous applications to retrieve AOT from Sea\u2010viewing Wide Field\u2010of\u2010view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements over land.    This orbit-level product (Short-name: AERDB_L2_VIIRS_SNPP) has an at-nadir resolution of 6 km x 6 km, and progressively increases away from nadir given the sensor\u2019s scanning geometry and Earth\u2019s curvature. Viewed differently, this product\u2019s resolution accommodates 8 x 8 native VIIRS moderate-resolution (M-band) pixels that nominally have ~750 m horizontal pixel size. The L2 Deep Blue AOT data products, at 550 nanometers reference wavelengths, are derived from particular VIIRS bands using two primary AOT retrieval algorithms: Deep Blue algorithm over land, and the Satellite Ocean Aerosol Retrieval (SOAR) algorithm over ocean. Although this product is called Deep Blue based on retrievals for the land algorithm, the data includes over-water retrievals as well.",

The VIIRS incarnation of the DT aerosol product is based on the same DT algorithm that was developed and used to derive products from the Terra and Aqua mission\u2019s MODIS instruments. Two separate and distinct DT algorithms exist. One helps retrieve aerosol information over ocean (dark in visible and longer wavelengths), while the second aids retrievals over vegetated/dark-soiled land (dark in the visible).",

        "description": "The prime objective of the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) is to measure wind speed and direction over the oceans, and the main operational application is the assimilation of ocean winds in NWP models. Other operational applications, based on the use of measurements of the backscattering coefficient, are sea ice edge detection and monitoring, monitoring sea ice, snow cover, soil moisture and surface parameters. This product consists of geo-located radar backscatter values along the six ASCAT beams. The different beam measurements are not collocated into a regular swath grid and the individual measurements are not spatially averaged. The resolution of each of the 255 backscatter values per each beam varies slightly along the beam, but it is approximately 10km (in the along beam direction) x 25 km (across the beam). This product is usually referred to as 'ASCAT Level 1B Full resolution product'. Note that some of the data are reprocessed. Please refer to the associated product validation reports or product release notes for further information.",

During June 2010, a campaign was undertaken in the coastal waters off Port Aransas, Texas to study the angular/temporal distribution of polarization in multiple environment types (eutrophic sediment laden coastal waters, oligotrophic off-shore), as well as the polarization-reflectance responses of several organisms. In addition to radiometric polarization measurements, water column IOPs, Rrs, benthic reflectance, and pigment concentration measurements were collected. Later campaigns expanded this research in the coastal waters off the Florida Keys.",

        "description": "The ALTUS Cloud Electrification Study (ACES) was based at the Naval Air Facility Key West in Florida. During August 2002, ACES researchers conducted overflights of thunderstorms over the southwestern corner of Florida. For the first time in NASA research, an uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) named ALTUS was used to collect cloud electrification data. Carrying field mills, optical sensors, electric field sensors and other instruments, ALTUS allowed scientists to collect cloud electrification data for the first time from above the storm, from its birth through dissipation. This experiment allowed scientists to achieve the dual goals of gathering weather data safely and testing new aircraft technology. This dataset consists of data collected from the following instruments: Slow/Fast antenna, Electric Field Mill, Optical Pulse Sensors, Searchcoil Magnetometer, Accelerometer, and Gerdien Conductivity Probe. These data were collected at 200KHz from the first 16 telemetry items collected on the aircraft, were initiated by an operator selected trigger (e.g. DOPS), and continued collecting for as long as the trigger continued.",
